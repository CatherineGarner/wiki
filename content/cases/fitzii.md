    content: >-
      菲茨伊由三个平行团队组成，分别负责产品与开发、销售与市场营销和成功招聘。每个团队都有一名高级人员负责战略和规划，但对团队的其他成员没有指挥权（菲茨伊使用建议流程和其他基于同事交流的流程进行决策）。


      菲茨伊维护一个维恩图来显示组织内三个团队之间的关系。每个团队负责自己的计划；两个团队之间的每个合作组合，都会在工作重叠的地方制定共享的计划；某些重要主题位于维恩图的中心，此处任何更改都需要三个团队的认可。“维恩中心”的主题包括菲茨伊的发展目标、战略和主题目标、可能对客户产生重大影响的产品和服务变化，以及自我管理等有关人力资源和文化的活动。

    title: 菲茨伊利用各种定期会议、传统会议和创新会议来鼓励团队建设、信息共享和决策。

      除必要的临时会议外，[菲茨伊](http://www.fitzii.com/)采用常规例会机制。


      每月一次的全团队会议——所有的菲茨伊同事都会参加每月一次的定期会议，该会议在两个办公地点之间轮流举行。对于一个在两个地点工作并且经常远程工作的团队来说，这确保了一个可预测的能面对面开会的机会。该例会的议程包括完整人性活动，如了解一位同事的活动，以及财务审查，以提高每个团队成员的财务意识并促进主人翁思维。任何人想得到整个团队对任何主题意见的人，都可以将其他主题自由添加到一个共享文档中（没有人控制议程）。


      一对一会议——传统的经理-员工一对一会议，已经被轮流随机配对的个人一对一会议所取代。这些会议被称为“蔚蓝约会”，有助于加强联系，增加对其他角色的了解，并为建议流程提供可预测的第一个联络点。每对蔚蓝约会会持续三个月。


      一般来说会高度重视良好的会议风格和推进方法。例如德博诺技术、基于任务的学习技术和公司原创的问题杜兹（DOAQ）会议风格就是例子。
  - topic: Coordination
    title: 菲茨伊促进协作的关键手段是每周更新公司的社交网络
    content: >-
      在[菲茨伊](https://www.fitzii.com/go/about/)，在一个名为Yammer的企业社交网络中，每周都会发生更新，这是分享信息和接受建议的关键手段。每个核心团队成员每周都会写一篇关于她/他的工作活动、建议流程和关注点的最新帖子。


      菲茨伊的每周信息更新对其沟通至关重要。每周更新确保每个团队成员都能定期访问有关业务的各种信息 – 从财务表现到客户关注点以及个人参与度 – 从而提高菲茨伊团队成员的一致性和参与度。菲茨伊的股东和咨询委员会也是Yammer小组的成员，他们偶尔会在每周更新或咨询委员会会议上添加鼓励意见或提出课题。
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: 每个团队负责进行自己的人员招聘，其他团队的成员也参加小组面试；使用为何/如何/什么（why/how/what）提问框架，来评估应聘者的适配度。
    content: >-
      作为一家招聘公司，[菲茨伊](http://www.fitzii.com/)自己的招聘也遵循严格的流程来评估新员工的成功潜力，流程包括心理测试和深入的小组面试。招聘决定权在于招聘团队，其他每个团队的代表也参与小组面试。重点是确保新员工能在职场经历有意义的工作，并得到菲茨伊团队的支持。


      在招聘团队核心成员时，需要评估三种基本类型的契合度：


      * 为何-在初步面试和小组面试时，通过谈话评估应聘者与菲茨伊进化目标的一致性；招聘的强烈愿望是，为与组织目标明确共鸣的新人找到岗位一致性

      * 如何-通过菲茨伊原创软件内的心理测试评估个人的行为特征

      * 什么-由相关职能团队对新员工将负责的岗位主要角色相关的知识、技能、能力进行评估


      在每一次招聘中，这些角度可能同样重要，也可能不一样。例如，雇佣一个程序员需要高水平的知识、技能和能力（重视什么/what），而雇佣一个将制定策略的高级人员则需要高度的组织目标一致性（为何/why）。
  - topic: Commitment, Working Hours and Flexibility
    title: 在菲茨伊，同事可以在任何有互联网连接的地方自由工作，同时致力于频繁的肉体见面。
    content: 在考虑工作时间和地点时，[菲茨伊](https://www.fitzii.com/go)成员致力于在自由和责任之间“保持一个平衡感”。同事可以在任何有互联网连接的地方工作（自由）。成员享受很大程度的灵活性，比如有人可以富有成效的在家里工作，或偶尔基于需要到另一个地点工作。比如，一个同事在迈阿密工作了一个星期，以探望生病的亲戚。实际上，同事主要在两个办公室工作——一个在安大略省的奥克维尔，另一个在安大略省的多伦多。大家都致力于肉身共度时光——人们经常听到首席执行官说“你们在一起的时间，如果没有浪费就是在建立社区连带感”——同事们每周二都会尽一切努力在奥克维尔（Oakville）工作，周四在多伦多（Toronto）工作（这是责任）。每月一次的团队会议在两个地点轮流举行；每年一次的团队集体静修，支撑着高质量的结构化和非结构化互动。
  - topic: Job Titles and Job Descriptions
    title: 菲茨伊没有固定的工作描述；同事根据他们的兴趣、才能和组织的需要担任一个或多个岗位角色。一个有用的标准职称，本身具有指导性和灵活性。
    content: >-
      [Fitzii](https://www.fitzii.com/go) has no set job descriptions; coworkers
      perform one or more roles based on their interests, talents, and the needs
      of the organization.


      Coworkers have one core role. Based on that core role, they are members of one of three functional teams – product & development, sales & marketing, and hiring success. Coworkers also have other roles not related to their core role. For convenience, simple lists of these roles exist in the company social network. They are as simple as “Hiring practice - Luz” so that it’s easy to identify the person currently playing a role.


      Otherwise, roles are not described per se; but if the goal of a traditional job description is to make clear what each person should be doing, the equivalent source of guidance is each team’s goals and plans document, which makes clear the current priorities of that team. In that sense, a coworker’s job description is to make progress on Fitzii’s purpose, specifically by achieving the goals and plans her functional team has committed to.


      Regarding job titles, it is common practice to use one’s team name as a title. For example – introducing oneself as “Carla from hiring success” or signing an email: Carla, Hiring Success, Fitzii. At the same time, in situations when it is more practical to use a conventional title, each person has freedom to do so. For example, it might be practical for a member of the sales & marketing team to identify himself as Fitzii’s marketing manager when addressing marketing services vendors. There is either enough peer pressure or good sense to avoid fancier ego-driven titles!
  - topic: Feedback and Performance Management
    title: Fitzii coworkers cite an annual, structured, self and peer review process
      as a highlight of their work and relationships.
    content: >-
      At [Fitzii](http://www.fitzii.com/), feedback of all kinds is frequently
      sought and given.


      Annually, every Fitzii coworker completes a self-assessment, answering these two questions (in an online performance management tool):


      * Assess your past year in terms of your accomplishments, important learning, and even mistakes that led to growth. Then tell us what areas of your performance you'd particularly like to get feedback about.


      Self-assessments are then shared with every other member of the Fitzii team, who review the content before responding with answers to these two questions:


      * What did NAME do well? Be sure to include the one thing you most value about working with NAME.


      * Considering how you have been affected by NAME, and what areas she's interested in hearing about, what is the feedback you would like to give that could best help her grow or improve?


      Peers are encouraged to write in “I” language and to share how they have been inspired, touch, hurt, etc. by the other person’s contributions. Feedback is not presented as objective truth. No numerical ratings or rankings are used.


      Each coworker then receives and reviews the feedback and prepares to attend a whole-team discussion in which every person shares new insights from the feedback process, as well as actions he or she wishes to take in response.
  - topic: board
    title: Board meetings are transparent and use a real-time agenda.
    content: >-
      [Fitzii ](http://www.fitzii.com/)is owned by a [B
      Corp](http://www.bcorporation.net/), The Ian Martin Group, whose CEO and
      senior leaders act as an advisory board. Monthly meetings between the two
      groups focus on surfacing conflict and seeking advice.


      The meeting agenda is created in “real time” at the beginning of every meeting. This reduces bureaucracy and any politicking for topics that may not interest the whole group, or have urgency. Each team head and board member shares four items: what s/he is a) focused on, b) excited about, c) concerned about, and d) tasks that need immediate attention. Urgent topics, and those of broad interest, are discussed, and others deferred. Meeting notes are accessible to all Fitzii team members.
  - topic: Staff Functions
    title: Fitzii has no dedicated staff functions. Individuals from functional
      teams volunteer to act as stewards of various staff functions, as needed.
    content: >-
      Fitzii is organized in three parallel teams along functional lines –
      product & development, sales & marketing, and hiring success. Every Fitzii
      employee is a member of one of these teams, depending on his or her core
      role.


      In addition, Fitzii team members volunteer to steward various staff roles such as finances, purchasing, and human resources. The individual steward accumulates expertise and moves decisions, actions, and projects forward. These allocations are based on individual interest and the team’s overall needs.


      A practical example: when Fitzii developed a peer-based 360-degree feedback process, various team members were interested in contributing. Initially, development of the new feedback process lagged as no one was clearly responsible for moving it forward. When the team noticed this, one coworker from the product & development team took the role of steward of the feedback process. He collected advice and opinions from other interested coworkers, proposed a process based on their advice, and took over practical implementation of the new practice. In that sense, the role is less about authority over a particular staff function and more about serving the team’s practical needs.


      Additionally, the team has regular access to subject matter experts from its parent company, the [Ian Martin Group,](http://ianmartin.com/) as well as external experts, such as legal counsel.
