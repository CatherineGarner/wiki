    title: 营销与市场 市场口号是“不要买我们的产品”？！
    content: 大多数品牌利用市场营销将潜在客户转化为实体客户，[巴塔哥尼亚](https://eu.patagonia.com/fr/fr/home/)则努力把顾客变成行星保护运动的积极分子。巴塔哥尼亚以刊登整版广告“别买这件夹克”而闻名。这些广告是巴塔哥尼亚“纽带伙伴关系”的一部分。巴塔哥尼亚认为，我们许多发达国家的人，衣橱里都有足够的衣服让我们一辈子保暖。然而，我们还是不断购买新衣服，这些衣服的生产对环境有害，最终会称为垃圾被填埋。纽带伙伴关系活动，倡导减少（制造耐用的衣服）、修复（巴塔哥尼亚为客户修复衣服）、再利用（公司在易趣或商店的旧衣服区转售客户的旧衣服）和回收（顾客可以把旧衣服退回巴塔哥尼亚，他们负责回收）。这一举措是否会在短期内损害巴塔哥尼亚的增长？是的。每一件经过修理和重复使用的夹克衫都会导致少买一件。这是否会通过提高客户忠诚度而增加长期增长？也许。但巴塔哥尼亚的决定并不是根据预测和财务状况驱动的。这家公司选择了组织目标所要求的做法。有关巴塔哥尼亚营销方法的更多信息，请参见[目的驱动的营销：巴塔哥尼亚如何利用讲故事将消费者转变为环保积极分子](https://www.fastcompany.com/3038557/the-purpose-driven-marketer-how-patagonia-uses-storything-to-turn-consum)。

    title: Extend information flow throughout the market, incorporating suppliers
      and customers
    content: "[Patagonia](https://eu.patagonia.com/fr/fr/home/) has gone beyond the
      boundaries of the organization with its \"Footprint Chronicles\".
      Information transparency has been extended to suppliers and customers.
      Customers can see where everthing is made, how it is made, what the
      conditions are like, what the impact of transportation and water usage is
      on the overall carbon footprint. A major part of the organization's
      purpose is served by employing this radical degree of honesty with regard
      to information and information flow when dealing with outside parties.
      Information exchange with suppliers and customers via email and internet
      is used to fuel continous improvement."

      Yvon Chouinard founded what would later be called
      [Patagonia](http://www.patagonia.com/) in 1957 to produce climbing pitons.
      The California-based company has grown into a leading outdoor apparel
      maker, committed to being a positive influence on the environment.


      In Patagonia hire is made slowly with interview from peers, as much as possible from withiɳ.

      [Patagonia ](http://www.patagonia.com/)embraced reduction of their
      environmental foot-print ― even at the risk of negative impact to the
      bottom line. Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia’s founder, gives this example:


      "In the mid-nineties, we decided to change the packaging of our thermal underwear. We were using a thick, wraparound cardboard header inside a heavy Ziploc plastic bag... For the heavier-weight expedition underwear, we decided to go without any packaging at all and hang them up like regular clothing... For the underwear made of lighter-weight material, we just rolled them up and put a rubber band around them. We were warned to be prepared for a 30 percent cut in sales... we were competing with companies...extremely competitive with their packaging... We did it anyway because it was the right thing to do. The first year this practice kept twelve tons of material from being shipped around the world... and being dumped into landfills... it saved the company $150,000 in unnecessary packaging... (and) brought us a 25 percent increase in thermal underwear sales. Since they weren’t hidden away in a package and had to be displayed like the regular clothing, people could feel the material and appreciate the quality. And since they were displayed like the other clothes, we were forced to make our underwear look like regular clothing, to the point that now most Capilene underwear tops can be worn as a regular shirt, fulfilling our goal of making clothes that are multifunctional."


      Most strikingly, [Patagonia ](http://www.patagonia.com/)resolved in the summer of 1994 to replace all conventionally grown cotton with organic cotton... The raw material cost three times more, and the cotton product line was reduced from 91 styles to 66. It was a big risk. And yet Patagonia felt there was no alternative... cotton fields that covered only three percent of the world’s farmland were responsible for 10 percent of the worldwide use of pesticide and 25 percent of the use of insecticides. Against all expectations, Patagonia’s organic cotton program turned out to be financially beneficial. More importantly, it has convinced others in the industry to follow suit.


      When the company moved its warehouse from California to Nevada, many colleagues moved too. Some realized that Nevada has lots of wild country and federal land, but very little of it was protected as wilderness. Four employees took the initiative. They got support from company leaders in the form of salries and facilities. They built a broad coalition, went to Washington, and lobbied. As a result, 1.2 million acres of wilderness were protected. ^\[Source: Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), pages 160-172]

      not undermine financial performance―indeed, quite the contrary.
  - topic: Ownership
    title: A privately held company formalizes its practices.
    content: Patagonia, the outdoor apparel maker, is 100% owned by its founder,
      Yves Chouinard and his wife.^[Patagonia's Founder Is America's Most
      Unlikely Business Guru; Wall St. Journal Magazine; April 26, 2012] Mr.
      Chouinard can therefore presumably do whatever he wants with Patagonia,
      and this no doubt has given him great freedom to guide the company into a
      Teal organization. Interestingly though, Patagonia has gone to the trouble
      of attaining benefit corporation status, perhaps as a result of
      Chouinard’s desire to give the company some protection from potential
      future owners or perhaps out of a desire to make a symbolic gesture.
      Patagonia has gone even further by becoming the first Californian company
      to achieve “B Corp certification” at the beginning of 2012 (while often
      confused, “benefit corporation” and “B Corp” are not the same). B Corp
      certification is a private certification issued by B Lab, a global
      non-profit, to companies which meet its standards of “verified, overall
      social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal
      accountability.”^[<https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/about-b-lab>]

    title: Children in Meetings
    content: "At its headquarters in Ventura, California, Patagonia hosts a Child
      Development Center for employees’ children, from a few months up to
      kindergarten age. Children’s laughter and chatter are among the regular
      sounds at the office, coming from the playground outside, from children
      visiting their parents’ desks, or from kids joining parents and colleagues
      for lunch at the cafeteria. It is not uncommon to see a mother nursing her
      child during a meeting. Relationships change subtly but profoundly when
      people see each other not only as colleagues, but also as people capable
      of the profound love and care young children inspire. When colleagues have
      just played with a baby over lunch, it’s that much harder to fly at each
      other’s throats when they sit in a meeting.^[Laloux, Frederic

  - topic: Evolutionary Purpose
    content: >-
      Yvon Chouinard, the founder and owner of Patagonia, didn’t set out to
      create a business at all, initially. Probably one of the people most
      unlikely to become a business founder, he stumbled on the purpose that
      would turn into a $540 million company employing 1,350 people.


      As a kid, he spent every free minute outdoors— rock-climbing, diving, and training hawks for hunting. A misfit in school, Chouinard remembers that the classroom was mostly “an opportunity for me to practice holding my breath, so that on weekends I could free-dive deeper to catch the abundant abalone and lobster off the Malibu coast.” When he left school, he lived with no income, finding shelter in shacks on the beach or near the mountains, hopping on freight trains in pursuit of the next climb or dive. In 1957, he bought a used coal-fired forge from a junkyard and taught himself blacksmithing to make his own climbing pitons. When a few friends asked him to produce pitons for them, he found a way to sustain his simple lifestyle. For years, he would fabricate pitons in the winter months, making just enough money to spend April to July on the walls of Yosemite, devote the summer to the mountains of Wyoming, and then go back to Yosemite in the fall until snow fell in November. He wouldn’t have been considered a businessman by anybody, least of all himself. Now, as the owner of a multimillion-dollar company, he has turned into one, but he hasn’t lost sight of the lights and shadows of the profession:


      > "I’ve been a businessman for almost fifty years. It’s as difficult for me to say those words as it is for someone to admit to being an alcoholic or a lawyer. I’ve never respected the profession. It’s business that has to take the majority of the blame for being the enemy of nature, for destroying native cultures, for taking from the poor and giving to the rich, and poisoning the earth with the effluent from its factories. Yet business can produce food, cure disease, control population, employ people, and generally enrich our lives. And it can do these good things and make a profit without losing its soul."^\[Yvon Chouinard, Let My People Go Surfing, p. 3.]


      Chouinard’s defining experience as a businessman came as he climbed up a mountain in 1970.


      > "After an ascent of the Nose route on El Capitan, which had been pristine a few summers earlier, I came home disgusted with the degradation I had seen. The repeated hammering of hard steel pitons, during both placement and removal in the same fragile cracks, were severely disfiguring the rock. Frost \[his friend and partner in the forge] and I decided we would phase out the piton business. … Pitons were the mainstay of our business, but we were destroying the very rocks we loved."^\[Yvon Chouinard, Let My People Go Surfing, p. 31.]


      Chouinard and Frost found an alternative to hard steel pitons: aluminum chocks that can be wedged by hand and leave the rock unaltered. Two years later, Chouinard edited his first product catalog, and within a few months, the piton business was done; chocks sold faster than they could be made. Yvon Chouinard stumbled upon a need of the climbing world when he found a way for the activity he and others loved not to create environmental damage.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).
