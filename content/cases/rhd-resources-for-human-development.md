      Se han escrito reglas básicas claras para crear un ambiente seguro y manejar de manera constructiva el conflicto y la ira dentro del contexto de los equipos autogestionados.\

      \

      Cada uno de los programas de RHD está dirigido por un equipo autogestionado, con un promedio de 20 y un máximo de 50 personas. Las unidades, como se llama a estos equipos, se les anima a desarrollar su propio sentido de propósito, orgullo e identidad. Las unidades son responsables de toda su operación. El personal central de la sede se mantiene al mínimo. El personal especializado puede asesorar a los equipos, pero la decisión final se mantiene en la unidad. En RHD, los equipos tienen un líder de equipo (llamado "Director de la Unidad"). Los Directores de Unidad no tienen poder para imponer decisiones y no pueden contratar o despedir unilateralmente a nadie.


      RHD se basa explícitamente en una serie de supuestos básicos sobre la gente y el trabajo, incluyendo que: 1) todas las personas son de igual valor humano, 2) las personas son esencialmente buenas a menos que se demuestre lo contrario, y 3) no hay una sola manera de gestionar las cuestiones corporativas bien.


      RHD ha desarrollado una Carta de Derechos y Responsabilidades para Empleados y Consumidores. Los dos primeros artículos explican el objetivo de RHD de crear un ambiente seguro y manejar de manera constructiva el conflicto y la ira. La organización ha identificado varios supuestos básicos, que guían las operaciones. Una es que hay múltiples caminos "correctos" o caminos que podemos seguir para tomar decisiones. Por lo tanto, no hay una realidad "verdadera" o "absoluta". Cada persona en una situación tiene su propia visión de la realidad y su propia perspectiva sobre la forma más eficaz de hacer las cosas. Mientras que el conflicto y la diferencia (o el desacuerdo) es algo normal que debemos esperar, las expresiones explosivas o hostiles de la cólera no son aceptables en RHD. Como miembro de la comunidad RHD, es importante ser capaz de hacer dos cosas: a) Separarse de nuestra propia necesidad de tener “la razón” para oír y respetar las realidades y perspectivas de los demás; y, b) Diferenciar entre los pensamientos (Lo que está pasando dentro de su cabeza) y comportamientos (lo que usted hace o dice).


      El documento continúa detallando cinco expresiones inaceptables de hostilidad. El primero, “discurso y comportamiento humillante", se describe en los siguientes términos: El discurso y la conducta de descalificación implican cualquier comportamiento verbal o no verbal que alguien haga y que socave la autoestima de otra persona e implique que él / ella es menos que valioso como ser humano. Tales comportamientos incluyen, pero no se limitan a, poner sobrenombres, ridiculizar, sarcasmo u otras acciones que "derriban" a la gente. Descalificar a una persona con tales comportamientos físicos como entornar sus ojos cuando la persona habla o negando de otra manera su importancia como miembro de la comunidad es también inaceptable. Cualquier persona que encuentre tal comportamiento hostil tiene el derecho y la responsabilidad de exponerlo como un problema. Otras expresiones de hostilidad incluyen "mensajes negativos triangulados", "amenaza de abandono", "descalificar la realidad de la otra persona" e "intimidación / explosión" se definen de manera igualmente precisa.


      "Por encima" de los equipos, no hay gerentes de nivel intermedio, sino líderes de hubs que apoyan un número de unidades. Los líderes del centro esperan ser informados de los principales problemas existentes o potenciales. Aunque ellos pueden aconsejar o ayudar, la responsabilidad de resolver problemas permanece en el equipo de colaboradoes.

  - topic: Recruitment
    title: Human Services - United States - 4,000 employees - Nonprofit  At RHD, the
      HR service is responsible for providing training, support and education of
      unit personnel regarding employment practices, but do not provide a
      centralized hiring process. RHD uses frequent peer reflection in all
      programs and groups to evaluate group composition, in order to adapt
      recruiting so they can provide a diverse workplace.
    content: >-
      [Resources for Human Development (RHD)](https://www.rhd.org/) is a
      Philadelphia-based nonprofit , 4,000 employees operating in 14 states,
      serving people in need through a variety of homes, shelters, and programs
      in areas such as mental disabilities, addiction recovery, and
      homelessness. It was founded in 1970 by Robert Fishman.


      In the [Bill of Rights and Responsibilities](http://www.rhd.org/docs/default-source/docs/RHDBillofRights.pdf?sfvrsn=0) (a document that spell out detailed ground rules for encouraging safe behaviors and identify inacceptable behaviors) is indicated that all programs and groups throughout the organization are requested to periodically look at the composition of the membership in their group, and to reflect on the reasons for and impacts of that composition. Based on such reflection, the group may want to make decisions about how it will move forward in creating and valuing a diverse membership.


      RHD holds a bi-monthly “isms in the workplace meeting.” Anyone feeling that the organization should pay attention to a specific form or occurrence of racism, sexism, or any other “-ism” can join the meeting. If noticed that the organization as a whole tends to hire disproportionately more white than black people, or that women generally don’t step into certain roles; there is no obvious party to confront; everyone is called to find a solution.
  - topic: Training and Coaching
    title: RHD sponsors a coaching program that offers 10 free counseling sessions
      for employees and/or their families every year.
    content: "No one else in the organization needs to be informed about the theme
      of the coaching, and it must not be a professional topic. The program is
      built on trust: if an employee is seeking support from an external coach,
      the topic must be important enough to be worth the money the company pays
      for it"
  - topic: Job Titles and Job Descriptions
    title: RHD consciously does not use job descriptions
    content: >-
      Bob Fishman, the founder of [RHD](https://www.rhd.org/), explains the
      benefits of not using job descriptions in his organization: RHD
      consciously does not use job descriptions. Instead, the assumption that
      people are essentially good leads us to believe that, once an employee has
      a general sense of the job, he or she will want to shape the way it is
      done.


      *Thelma, for instance, had already been working as a receptionist at our new outpatient clinic for many years when she asked me for a job description. … I felt, and so told her, that it was absurd for me to define the details of her work since she was already doing a quality job. One of her outstanding behaviors was the kindness with which she greeted our clients, brought them coffee, and made sure that the therapist took them into the therapy room in a timely manner. Delineating her kindness was impossible: words would never have done justice to her heartfelt warmth. Thelma already knew how to perform her job and a detailed job description, I believed, would have done her more harm than good. … There is no single way to define a job, and no supervisor has the answer to how another person’s job should be performed. If … I imposed my view on her job, the corporation would, in effect, lose her special contribution - her way of managing the relationship between people. That would have been a great loss.*
  - topic: Compensation and incentives
    title: RHD has put in place a number of practices to boost the lowest salaries
      and reduce pay inequality
    content: RHD, a Philadelphia based non-profit, holds the principle that when
      there is room for salary increases, they should be disproportionately
      geared toward the lowest salaries first. The CEO’s salary is capped to a
      maximum of 14 times the lowest salary in the organization. One can argue
      about the multiple―is it too high or too low?―but RHD introduced a clever
      twist by capping the highest salary not based on the average or median
      salary, as many Green Organizations have started doing, but on the lowest.
      It’s now very much in the CEO’s and the leadership’s own interest to
      ensure that even the colleagues with the lowest qualification earn enough
      for a decent living. Next to this direct focus on entry-level salaries,
      RHD has set up a scholarship fund to offer staff members opportunities to
      pursue formal education and increase their earning potential. And it has
      instituted a companion currency, the RHD Equal Dollar, that allows
      lower-paid colleagues to increase their access to goods and services by
      trading with each other and with their local community.
  - topic: Purchasing and Investments
    title: RHD runs its organization based on self-managing units which are
      responsible for their entire operation, from defining a strategy to
      recruiting and purchasing, from budgeting to monitoring results.
      Investment decisions stay within the units, which are counseled by budget
      managers who bring in financial expertise.
    content: Each of [RHD](https://www.rhd.org/)’s programs is run by a
      self-managing team, with an average of 20 and at most 40 to 50 people.
      Units, as these teams are called within RHD, are encouraged to develop
      their own sense of purpose, pride, and identity. Within the units, there
      are no job descriptions. Units are responsible for their entire operation,
      from defining a strategy to recruiting and purchasing, from budgeting to
      monitoring results. Central staff at headquarters is kept to a minimum.
      Specialist staff - for instance, the budget managers that support teams in
      financial matters or specialists in clinical review - can counsel teams,
      but the final decision is kept in the unit. ^[Laloux, Frederic.

  - topic: Fundamental Assumptions
    title: Three beliefs for people, workers and management.
    content: |-
      1. All people are of equal human worth.

      2. People are essentially good, unless proven otherwise.

      3. There is no single way to manage corporate issues well.

    title: An organizational Bill of Rights
    content: >-
      RHD has developed over the years a beautiful and precisely worded Bill of
      Rights and Responsibilities for Employees and Consumers. The first two
      articles spell out RHD’s objective of creating a safe environment and
      constructively managing conflict and anger. (Later articles deal with
      topics related to self-management.) The premise is maintained that
      conflict is inevitable, but that hostile behaviors are not:


      *This corporation has chosen to operate with several basic assumptions. One of those assumptions is that there are multiple “right” ways or paths we can follow in making decisions, thus there is no one “true” or “absolute” reality. Each person in a situation holds his/ her own view of reality, and his/ her own perspective about the most effective way to do things. This assumption allows us to recognize that conflict is inevitable and that people will disagree in the workplace. While conflict and difference (or disagreement) are to be expected, explosive or otherwise hostile expressions of anger are not acceptable in RHD. As a member of the RHD community, it is important to be able to do two things: a) Separate from our own need to be “right” in order to hear and respect others’ realities and perspectives: and, b) Differentiate between thoughts (what’s going on inside your head) and behaviors (what you do or say).^\[Robert Fishman and Barbara Fishman, The Common Good Corporation: The Experiment Has Worked! (Philadelphia: The Journey to Oz Press, 2006), 165.]*


      The document goes on to spell out in detail five unacceptable expressions of hostility. The first, demeaning speech and behavior, is described in the following terms:


      *Demeaning speech and behavior involves any verbal or nonverbal behavior that someone experiences as undermining of that person’s self-esteem and implies that he/she is less than worthy as a human being. Such behaviors include, but are not limited to, name-calling, ridicule, sarcasm, or other actions which “put down” people. Demeaning a person with such physical behaviors as rolling one’s eyes when the person speaks or otherwise negating her importance as a member of the community is also unacceptable. Anyone encountering such hostile behavior has the right and responsibility to surface it as an issue.^\[Robert Fishman and Barbara Fishman, The Common Good Corporation: The Experiment Has Worked! (Philadelphia: The Journey to Oz Press, 2006), 165.]*


      Other expressions of hostility ”negative triangulated messages,” “threat of abandonment,” “disconfirming the other person’s reality,” and “intimidation/explosion” are defined in an equally precise manner.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).
