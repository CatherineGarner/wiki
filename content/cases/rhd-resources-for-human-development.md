    title: 文化与价值观   经过多年积累，RHD为员工和消费者制定了一份措辞准确的权利和责任法案。
    content: >-
      法案的前两篇文章阐述RHD的目标：创造一个安全的环境，建设性地管理冲突和愤怒。（其后的文章讨论与自我管理相关的话题）。他们基于一个前提：冲突是不可避免的，但敌对行为可以避免。


      价值观会议：每两个月，RHD的所有同事都会被邀请参加价值观运用会议，人们可以在会上提出他们在工作场所遇到的价值观问题，或者对权利和责任法案提出修改建议。参加会议的人很多。RHD的创始人鲍勃费什曼（Bob Fishman）每次都保证能出席。
  - topic: Safe Space
    title: 安全安心空间   RHD制定了一份名为《权利和责任法案》的书面文件，详细阐述了用于激励安全安心行为并识别不可接受行为的基本规则（见附件）。
    content: 经过多年积累，RHD制定了一份措辞精确的“员工与消费者权利和责任法案”。该文件除其他内容外，还涵盖了冲突解决、愤怒表达、识别并管理敌意、决策、管理分歧和公开交流等主题。
  - topic: Conflict resolution
    title: 冲突解决   公司制定了明确的基本规则，目的是创造一个安全安心的环境，并在自我管理团队的背景下建设性地管理冲突和愤怒。

      RHD的每一个项目都由一个自我管理团队管理，平均20人，最多50人。这些团队被称为单位。RHD鼓励单位团队培养自己的目标感、自豪感和认同感。各单位负责管理组织自己全部行动。总部的中央管理人员保持在最低限度。总部的专业人员可以为团队提供咨询，但最终决定权仍在基层团队。在RHD，每个团队有个团队负责人（称为“部门主管”）。但单位团队负责人无权作出独裁决定，也不能单方面雇用或解雇任何人。


      RHD组织运作，明确基于许多关于人和工作的基本假设之上。包括：1）所有人作为人都具有同等的价值；2）除非另有证明，否则相信人之处性本善；3）管理公司各种问题的好方法不只一个。


      RHD为员工和消费者制定了权利和责任法案。法案的前两篇文章阐述了RHD的目标：创造一个安全安心的环境，建设性地管理冲突和愤怒。该组织确定了几个基本假设，这些假设指导着业务活动。其一是，我们可以遵循多种“正确”的方式或路径来做决策。因此，事实不只一个，不存在“真实”或“绝对”现实。每个人在一个情境中，都有他/她自己对现实的看法，以及他/她对最有效做事方式的看法。虽然冲突和分歧（或不一致）是可预料的，但在RHD不接受发脾气或其他敌对性愤怒表达。作为RHD社区的一员，重要的是能够做两件事：a）远离想表达自己最“正确”的欲望，以便倾听和尊重他人看到的事实和观点；b）区分思想（你头脑中的情景）和行为（你的言行）。


      这份文件接着详细阐述了五种不可接受的敌意表达。第一种是“贬低言语和行为”，用以下术语描述：贬低言语和行为包括任何一种“有人认为这种行为损害了自己的自尊，并感到在暗示他/她不值得作为一个人存在”的言语或非言语行为。此类行为包括但不限于骂人、嘲笑、挖苦或其他“贬低”他人的行为。用诸如说话时翻白眼或以其他方式，否定他/她作为社区成员的重要性等身体行为，来贬低一个人，都是不可接受的。任何遇到这种敌对行为的人，都有权利也有责任将其作为一个问题公开揭发。敌意的其他表达方式包括“负面三角信息”、“遗弃威胁”、“不确认对方的真实情况”和“恐吓/发怒”，法案中对这些也都进行了同样准确的定义。


      在团队之“上”，没有中层管理人员，只有一些支持多个单位的枢纽领导。总部的中心领导希望随时了解存在或潜在的重大问题。虽然他们可能会提供建议或帮助，但解决问题的责任和权限仍放在基层团队。
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: 招聘   RHD，人力资源服务-美国-4000名员工-RHD-非营利组织。RHD的人力资源服务部门负责为单位人员提供有关就业实践的培训、支持和教育，但不提供集中的招聘流程。RHD在所有项目和团队中，通过频繁的同侪反思来评估团队人员组成，以便为招聘活动提供需求，进而提供多样化的工作场所。

      [人力资源促进发展（RHD）](https://www.rhd.org/)是一家总部位于美国费城的非营利组织。RHD在美国14个州拥有4000名员工，通过各种家庭、庇护所和项目为有需要的人提供服务，这些项目涉及精神残疾、戒毒和无家可归者等领域。它是由罗伯特·菲什曼于1970年创立的。


      RHD的[权利和责任法案](http://www.rhd.org/docs/default-source/docs/RHDBillofRights.pdf？sfvrsn=0)（详细描述一些基本原则的文档，目的是为了鼓励安全行为和识别不可接受行为）中，要求整个组织的所有计划和小组定期检查其小组成员的组成，并反思形成这一人员结构的原因和影响。基于这样的反思结果，组织可以做出合理决策，以便在打造并重视成员组成多样化方面更上一层楼。


      RHD每两个月举行一次“职场xx主义揭发会”。任何一个人，如果感到组织应该关注某一特定形式或兆头的种族主义、性别歧视或任何其他“歧视”倾向，就可以自由参加会议揭发。比如，注意到组织作为一个整体，倾向于雇用不成比例的白人多于黑人，或者女性通常不踏入某些岗位禁区。不存在明显的对抗派别，要求每个人都积极自主的寻找解决方案。
  - topic: Training and Coaching
    title: RHD sponsors a coaching program that offers 10 free counseling sessions
      for employees and/or their families every year.
    content: "No one else in the organization needs to be informed about the theme
      of the coaching, and it must not be a professional topic. The program is
      built on trust: if an employee is seeking support from an external coach,
      the topic must be important enough to be worth the money the company pays
      for it"
  - topic: Job Titles and Job Descriptions
    title: RHD consciously does not use job descriptions
    content: >-
      Bob Fishman, the founder of [RHD](https://www.rhd.org/), explains the
      benefits of not using job descriptions in his organization: RHD
      consciously does not use job descriptions. Instead, the assumption that
      people are essentially good leads us to believe that, once an employee has
      a general sense of the job, he or she will want to shape the way it is
      done.


      *Thelma, for instance, had already been working as a receptionist at our new outpatient clinic for many years when she asked me for a job description. … I felt, and so told her, that it was absurd for me to define the details of her work since she was already doing a quality job. One of her outstanding behaviors was the kindness with which she greeted our clients, brought them coffee, and made sure that the therapist took them into the therapy room in a timely manner. Delineating her kindness was impossible: words would never have done justice to her heartfelt warmth. Thelma already knew how to perform her job and a detailed job description, I believed, would have done her more harm than good. … There is no single way to define a job, and no supervisor has the answer to how another person’s job should be performed. If … I imposed my view on her job, the corporation would, in effect, lose her special contribution - her way of managing the relationship between people. That would have been a great loss.*
  - topic: Compensation and incentives
    title: RHD has put in place a number of practices to boost the lowest salaries
      and reduce pay inequality
    content: RHD, a Philadelphia based non-profit, holds the principle that when
      there is room for salary increases, they should be disproportionately
      geared toward the lowest salaries first. The CEO’s salary is capped to a
      maximum of 14 times the lowest salary in the organization. One can argue
      about the multiple―is it too high or too low?―but RHD introduced a clever
      twist by capping the highest salary not based on the average or median
      salary, as many Green Organizations have started doing, but on the lowest.
      It’s now very much in the CEO’s and the leadership’s own interest to
      ensure that even the colleagues with the lowest qualification earn enough
      for a decent living. Next to this direct focus on entry-level salaries,
      RHD has set up a scholarship fund to offer staff members opportunities to
      pursue formal education and increase their earning potential. And it has
      instituted a companion currency, the RHD Equal Dollar, that allows
      lower-paid colleagues to increase their access to goods and services by
      trading with each other and with their local community.
  - topic: Purchasing and Investments
    title: RHD runs its organization based on self-managing units which are
      responsible for their entire operation, from defining a strategy to
      recruiting and purchasing, from budgeting to monitoring results.
      Investment decisions stay within the units, which are counseled by budget
      managers who bring in financial expertise.
    content: Each of [RHD](https://www.rhd.org/)’s programs is run by a
      self-managing team, with an average of 20 and at most 40 to 50 people.
      Units, as these teams are called within RHD, are encouraged to develop
      their own sense of purpose, pride, and identity. Within the units, there
      are no job descriptions. Units are responsible for their entire operation,
      from defining a strategy to recruiting and purchasing, from budgeting to
      monitoring results. Central staff at headquarters is kept to a minimum.
      Specialist staff - for instance, the budget managers that support teams in
      financial matters or specialists in clinical review - can counsel teams,
      but the final decision is kept in the unit. ^[Laloux, Frederic.

  - topic: Fundamental Assumptions
    title: Three beliefs for people, workers and management.
    content: |-
      1. All people are of equal human worth.

      2. People are essentially good, unless proven otherwise.

      3. There is no single way to manage corporate issues well.

    title: An organizational Bill of Rights
    content: >-
      RHD has developed over the years a beautiful and precisely worded Bill of
      Rights and Responsibilities for Employees and Consumers. The first two
      articles spell out RHD’s objective of creating a safe environment and
      constructively managing conflict and anger. (Later articles deal with
      topics related to self-management.) The premise is maintained that
      conflict is inevitable, but that hostile behaviors are not:


      *This corporation has chosen to operate with several basic assumptions. One of those assumptions is that there are multiple “right” ways or paths we can follow in making decisions, thus there is no one “true” or “absolute” reality. Each person in a situation holds his/ her own view of reality, and his/ her own perspective about the most effective way to do things. This assumption allows us to recognize that conflict is inevitable and that people will disagree in the workplace. While conflict and difference (or disagreement) are to be expected, explosive or otherwise hostile expressions of anger are not acceptable in RHD. As a member of the RHD community, it is important to be able to do two things: a) Separate from our own need to be “right” in order to hear and respect others’ realities and perspectives: and, b) Differentiate between thoughts (what’s going on inside your head) and behaviors (what you do or say).^\[Robert Fishman and Barbara Fishman, The Common Good Corporation: The Experiment Has Worked! (Philadelphia: The Journey to Oz Press, 2006), 165.]*


      The document goes on to spell out in detail five unacceptable expressions of hostility. The first, demeaning speech and behavior, is described in the following terms:


      *Demeaning speech and behavior involves any verbal or nonverbal behavior that someone experiences as undermining of that person’s self-esteem and implies that he/she is less than worthy as a human being. Such behaviors include, but are not limited to, name-calling, ridicule, sarcasm, or other actions which “put down” people. Demeaning a person with such physical behaviors as rolling one’s eyes when the person speaks or otherwise negating her importance as a member of the community is also unacceptable. Anyone encountering such hostile behavior has the right and responsibility to surface it as an issue.^\[Robert Fishman and Barbara Fishman, The Common Good Corporation: The Experiment Has Worked! (Philadelphia: The Journey to Oz Press, 2006), 165.]*


      Other expressions of hostility ”negative triangulated messages,” “threat of abandonment,” “disconfirming the other person’s reality,” and “intimidation/explosion” are defined in an equally precise manner.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).
