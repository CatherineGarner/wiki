    title: 会议  霍尔万创建了一套为各种特定目的服务的有效会议形态。
    content: >-
      霍尔万共有4种会议类型：


      所有会议都以“登入”流程开场，以“登出”结束。


      战术会议：为日常操作流程服务的简短的每日或每周会议。工作都是在这里得到协调。在此协调具体的操作流程，决定行动，完成事情。


      战略会议：这类会议不经常召开，没有具体的形式和过程，主要用来思考如何最好地服务于组织的[进化目标](../evolutional-purpose/)。


      专题会议：当某一专题需要特别关注时举行的会议。这些会议也没有具体形式。


      管理会议：这些会议仅限于处理岗位角色和协作，而不是为了讨论具体如何完工作所需的成杂乱无章过程。后者在战术会议上处理。管理会议通常每月举行一次。遵循严格的程序，以确保每个人的声音都能被听到，并且确保没有人能独裁的主宰[决策](../decision-making/)。会议主持人通过以下流程指导会议程序：


      1.提出建议


      2.澄清问题


      3.反馈


      4.修改和澄清


      5.反对意见


      6.集成


      这个过程听起来可能很正式，需要一些时间来习惯。但使用的人报告说，他们感到这个流程能带来人性解放，而且效率非常高。

      [HolacracyOne ](https://www.holacracy.org/holacracyone/about)has set up a
      company-wide Role Marketplace in order to make trading roles easy. On the
      company’s intranet is a file where colleagues can “rate” every role they
      currently fill, using a scale of -3 to +3:


      * If they find the role energizing (+) or draining (-). 

      * If they find their talents aligned (+) or not (-) with this role. 

      * If they find their current skills and knowledge conducive to (+) or limiting in (-) this role.


      Using the same scale of -3 to +3, people can also signal their interest in roles currently filled by other people. The marketplace thus helps people wanting to offload or pick up roles.
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: Team members qualify candidates based on fit for organization, purpose
      and role.
    content: >-
      [HolacracyOne](http://www.holacracyone.com/) is a training, consulting,
      and research company dedicated to spreading a new organizational model,
      “holcacray”, originally developed by Brian Robertson and his team at
      Ternary Software, a Philadelphia-based start-up. After transferring
      Ternary to new leadership, Robertson co-founded HolacracyOne.


      During the recruitment process, teammates check if


      * the person is “fit for organization” i.e. Is this person in resonance and energized by the evolutionary purpose, intrinsically motivated and comfortable with complex ever changing environment.

      * If yes, they check if the candidate is “fit for role”.
  - topic: Role Definition and Allocation
    title: An internal "Role Market place" to help in trading roles
    content: >-
      HolacracyOne has set up a company-wide Role Market Place in order to make
      trading roles easy (in holacratic language, this is an “app;” it’s not
      part of the basic operating system). On the company’s intranet is a file
      where colleagues can “rate” every role they currently fill, using a scale
      of -3 to +3:


      * If they find the role energizing (+) or draining (-).

      * If they find their talents aligned (+) or not (-) with this role.

      * If they find their current skills and knowledge conducive to (+) or limiting in (-) this role.


      Using the same scale of -3 to +3, people can also signal their interest in roles currently filled by other people. The market place helps people wanting to offload or pick up roles.
  - topic: Commitment, Working Hours and Flexibility
    title: HolacracyOne uses a regular meeting practice for colleagues to share and
      discuss commitment.
    content: During these meetings, colleagues discuss how much time and energy, at
      that moment in their lives, they want to commit to the organization’s
      purpose. The rationale behind this regular meeting is for each person to
      make a conscious choice about how much time and energy they are willing to
      commit. At the same time, the meeting practice gives all colleagues a
      conscious way of holding and recognizing that as humans, everyone has
      multiple endeavors that interest and enliven them, and that each person is
      choosing how much time and energy they want to give to any particular
      purpose^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker
      (2014), page 182].
  - topic: Compensation and incentives
    title: "HolacracyOne, the small consultancy/training company behind Holacracy,
      uses a ranking mechanism, which feeds an algorithm that allocates
      colleagues to salary bands. "
    content: >-
      Once a year, colleagues at HolacracyOne fill out a survey for all their
      colleagues, consisting of only two questions:


      * “This person contributes (much) more or (much) less than me.” (On a scale of -3 to +3)

      * “This person has a good basis to evaluate me.” (On a scale of 1 to 5)


      A simple algorithm crunches through the answers and groups colleagues into a few salary buckets. The more experienced, knowledgeable, and hard-working people land in the higher buckets that earn bigger salaries; the more junior, less experienced colleagues naturally gravitate toward buckets with lower salaries.^[Interview Frederic Laloux with Tom Thomison, 2013]
