      ##### 表扬会：


      每周五下午，全校学生、老师和教职员工开例会一小时。会议开始时一起唱首歌，将人们带回社区感。剩下的会议时间是没有议程安排的。


      讲台上有一个开放式麦克风，和一个简单的规则：我们在这里互相表扬和感谢。在接下来的50分钟里，感到有必要这样做的学生和老师会自动站起来走上讲台，拿起麦克风，关于在本周早些时候所做或所说的事情，来表扬或感谢另一学生或老师；他们坐下后，其他人会接过讲台。麦克风前的每个人都分享一个小故事，这个小故事揭示了两个人的某些情况：讲故事的人和被表扬或感谢的人。


      学生和老师都认为这各周例会对于培育学校非凡的学习、协作和成熟人性具有决定性的效果。

      Each Friday afternoon, the [entire
      school](http://www.ev-schule-zentrum.de/aktuell/)―students, teachers, and
      staff―gathers for an hour in a large hall. They start by singing a song
      together. The rest of the time together is unscripted. There is an open
      microphone on stage, and a simple rule: we are here to praise and thank
      each other.


      For the next 50 minutes, students and teachers who wish to do so stand up, walk on stage, take the microphone, and praise or thank another student or teacher for something they did or said during the week. They then sit down and someone else takes the stage. Every person at the microphone shares a mini-story that reveals something about two people―the storyteller and the person being thanked.


      This practice erases boundaries between students and teachers. It’s part of the human condition that everyone at some point feels down, confused, or stuck and in need of help. And everyone has the gift of empathy, of finding ways to offer support, comfort, and friendship. It takes courage to stand up and praise others publicly, but in the school it has become practice.


      Students don’t shy away from stories that are funny or touching, and heartfelt. Students and teachers credit this weekly session as the defining practice for the school’s extraordinary spirit of learning, collaboration, and maturity. Each story of kindness, courage, care, or professionalism told at the microphone is a thread woven into a rich tapestry of gratitude that has become key to the school’s exceptional learning culture. Faculty meetings have now integrated the same practice: they always start with a round of praise.
  - topic: Conflict resolution
    title: Innovative curriculum and organizational model that fosters a sense of
      community and encourages the surfacing and resolution of conflict.
    content: At ESBZ , a large school has been broken down into smaller, self
      governing units, to create a sense of community within mini-schools. In
      addition, all teachers and students are trained in [Nonviolent
      Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication).
      Utilizing these and other conflict resolution skills, every class gets
      together at a fixed time each week to discuss and deal with tensions in
      the group. The meeting is facilitated by a student who enforces a number
      of ground rules that keep the discussion safe.
  - topic: wholeness
    title: The "Praise Meeting"
    content: "[ESBZ ](http://www.ev-schule-zentrum.de/aktuell/)has an extraordinary
      trust and community-building practice based around storytelling: the
      “praise meeting.” Every Friday afternoon, the entire school— students,
      teachers, and staff— comes together for an hour in a large hall. They
      always start by singing a song together, to settle into community. All the
      rest of the time together is unscripted. There is an open microphone on
      stage, with a simple rule: we are here to praise and thank each other. For
      the next 50 minutes, students and teachers who feel called to do so stand
      up, walk up on stage, take the microphone, and praise or thank another
      student or teacher for something they did or said earlier in the week;
      then they go sit down again and someone else takes the stage. Every person
      at the microphone shares what is essentially a miniature story that
      reveals something about two people— the storyteller and the person being
      praised or thanked— in their struggles and in their glories.[Laloux,
