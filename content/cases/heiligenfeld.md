    title: 海利根费尔德每周都有大型的集体反思会议。
    content: >-
      大型集体反思会议：


      每周二上午，350名员工聚集在一起共同反思。（其他同事需要陪伴病人。）


      每周都有一个新的相关话题被提上议事日程。主题包括：\[冲突解决]（../conflict resolution/）、处理失败、\[组织文化与价值观]（../culture and values/），以及类似的内容。


      会议以陈述主题开场。


      会议的核心是小组自我反省。例如，主题“处理失败”：通过一个简短的演讲介绍优雅处理失败的方法——当我们不再对自己的失败进行评判时，新的可能性会如此这般的被打开等等。


      然后人们把椅子拖来拖去，形成一个6到10人的小组。他们在自己选出的主持人的指导下，分组思考这个话题。


      在某个时刻，一个麦克风在整个房间传递，人们可以自由分享讨论中的内容。


      这些会议没有被脚本化的结果：没有预期的最终成果定义。除了个人得到学习机会之外，集体见解也应运而生。当人们返回工作岗位时，都会主动采取行动。


      这是一种耗时的做法，但是\[海利根费尔德]的人们(http://www.heiligenfeld.de/)说，好处远远大于投入的代价。这些会议就像给全公司打类固醇般的培训计划。


      共同的经历也培养了社区连带感和共同语言。在一次这样的会议结束时，海利根费尔德的一名员工站起来说：“你知道，我希望家里也能有更多的海利根费尔德精神。

      反思实践案例


      在[海利根费尔德](http://www.heiligenfeld.de/)，每周二上午，350名员工聚在一起进行一个半小时的共同反思。每周会有一个与当下相关、有利于自我反省的新话题被提上议事日程。最近的会议反映了各种各样的主题，如冲突解决、处理失败、公司价值观、人际沟通、官僚制度、IT创新、风险管理、个人健康和正念。会议总是以一个简短的陈述开始，然后分小组进行自我反思。每个小组都会选出一位主持人，他会执行一些基本规则，创造一个安全的探索空间，成员都坦诚的让自己展示真实的、有时是脆弱的人性。在小范围内同事的倾听过程帮助下，人们敢于深入挖掘，获得关于自己和他人的新见解。同事们每周都会置身于一个由一些基本规则创造的安全空间，而这些规则要求他们作真正的自己。他们学会了用深厚的人性之光，透过自己的勇气力量以及弱点之美来看待彼此。在会议中建立起来的信任、同理心和同情心，远远超出了会议室的范围。这些感觉开始渗透到整个组织。

      **Example for Team supervision**


      [Heiligenfeld ](http://www.heiligenfeld.de/)has developed a simple practice of team supervision. The company works with four external coaches who each have their domain of expertise (relationships, organizational development, system thinking, leadership). There are a number of time slots with the coaches every month that teams can sign up for. The recommendation is for every team to hold at least one session a year; on average teams hold two to four. In the discussion, with the help of the outside supervisor, colleagues can explore what a tension reveals about themselves and how they can grow to resolve it.
  - topic: Conflict resolution
    title: Innovative management practices are used to create a supportive work
      culture that fosters trust, empathy and compassion, while decreasing
      conflict.
    content: At Heiligenfeld every Tuesday morning, all 350 employees come together
      for an hour and a quarter to engage in joint reflection. Every week, a new
      topic that is current and conducive to self-reflection is put on the
      agenda. Recent meetings have reflected on subjects as diverse as conflict
      resolution, dealing with failure, company values, interpersonal
      communication, bureaucracy, IT innovations, risk management, personal
      health and mindfulness. The meeting always kicks off with a short
      presentation to frame the subject matter, followed by self-reflection in
      small groups. Every group elects a facilitator who enforces ground rules
      that create a space where it’s safe to explore, to be authentic and
      vulnerable. In the confines of the small group, helped by their
      colleagues’ listening, people dare to dig deep and gain new insights about
      themselves and others. Colleagues are exposed every week to a space made
      safe by ground rules that invites them to truly be themselves. They learn
      to see each other in the light of their deep humanity, in the beauty of
      their strengths and vulnerability. The trust, empathy and compassion that
      develop in these meetings expand to permeate the whole organization
  - topic: Strategy
    title: Strategy is developed through sensing rather than forecasting.
    content: "Heiligenfeld uses large group meetings at regular intervals to sense
      into its future. From one such session, the vision emerged of bringing
      Heiligenfeld’s holistic approach to mental illness to families with
      children and adolescents. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if patients could be
      treated together with their close family members, in a way that would
      specifically address and honor the family ties in the therapy? A year
      later, they opened, a new mental health hospital specifically dedicated to
      therapy for families.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing

      Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 4460-4463). Nelson Parker.

  - topic: wholeness
    title: Company-wide reflection
    content: "Among the great number of innovative management practices Heiligenfeld
      has introduced over the years, employees often credit one practice in
      particular for making the company an outstanding workplace. Every Tuesday
      morning, 350 or so employees come together for an hour and a quarter to
      engage in joint reflection (as many as don’t need to be with patients and
      as the size of the room will allow). Each week, a new topic that is
      relevant at the moment and conducive to self-reflection is put on the
      agenda - subjects as diverse as conflict resolution, dealing with failure,
      company values, interpersonal communication, bureaucracy, IT innovations,
      risk management, personal health, and mindfulness.\r

      \r

      The meeting always kicks off with a short presentation to frame the
      subject matter. But the heart of the meeting happens in small groups
      engaged in self-reflection. Let’s take the example of the topic “dealing
      with failure” to illustrate how this event plays out at Heiligenfeld. The
      short plenary presentation introduces ways to deal gracefully with
      failure— how new possibilities open up when we stop being judgmental about
      our failures; how from a higher place of consciousness we can view failure
      as life’s invitation to expand our skills and awareness and grow into more
      of who we are.\r

      \r

      After this short introduction, people shuffle their chairs around to
      create groups of six to ten people. In the groups, people are asked to
      reflect on the topic— how they deal with failure in their lives, at work
      and at home, individually and collectively. Every group elects a
      facilitator who enforces a few ground rules to create a space where it’s
      safe to explore, to be authentic and vulnerable. In the confines of the
      small group, helped by their colleagues’ listening, people dare to dig
      deep and gain new insights about themselves and others. At some point, a
      microphone goes around the room and people who feel inclined to do so
      share what came up for them in the discussion. There is no scripted
      outcome to these meetings, no expected end product; everyone comes out of
      the meeting with his or her own personal learning. Often, collective
      insights emerge, as well as decisions and initiatives that are then
      carried out when people go back to work.\r

      \r

      It’s a time-consuming practice for sure - 75 minutes every week for
      more than half of the company. But people at Heiligenfeld say the benefits
      far outweigh the costs. These large group meetings are like a company-wide
      training program on steroids; the whole organization grows its way through
      one topic after another, week after week.[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).
