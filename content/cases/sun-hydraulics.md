  来自[太阳液压](https://www.sunhydrulics.com/about)自己网站的信息，说这是一家领先的高性能旋入式液压插装阀和阀组的设计和制造商，这些插装阀和阀组用于控制动力、速度和运动，是流体动力系统的组件。


  太阳液压自1970年开始经营，自1997年开始上市，于2018年成为太阳神科技公司（纳斯达克：SNHY）。太阳液压LLC是这家新公司名下的全资子公司，主要通过独立分销商在全球范围内向不同的移动和工业设备及机械制造商市场销售其产品。

    title: 岗位定义与任务分派  采用一种内部招聘过程，由未来的同事面试某个职位的候选人。
    content: >-
      在太阳液压，微小的角色变化通常自然有机地发生，人们只是简单地站出来自主担任一个岗位角色，或者就需要有人来担任的岗位展开对话。


      如果创建了一个更大的岗位角色或出现一组现有岗位的空缺时（比如说需要一个自动化工程师），就会自然发生一个内部招聘过程。应聘者由将与担任新职位的人进行最密切合作的同事负责面试。

    title: 入职   在太阳液压，所有新员工的入职过程，都开始于一次制造生产线之旅，在开始担任被雇佣的岗位之前，会先学习操作几个工作站。
    content: >-
      在[太阳液压](http://www.sunhydrulics.com/)，所有新员工入职都开始于“制造生产线旅”，不管他们未来的岗位是什么；他们不仅学会操作一个工作站，还要学会操作多个工作站。对于钟点工，这个轮训会持续两到四周，他们要在四到六个不同的区域工作。对于工薪员工来说，则需要更长的时间：在车间工作一到四个月。只有到轮训结束时，他们才开始承担起被雇佣的岗位角色。


      为什么入职轮训要这么长时间？太阳液压的员工认为，与公司其他员工建立关系，有助于从各个角度深入理解这个组织。一个自我管理的环境提供了让事情自然发生的机会，刻意自由地接触到同事，共同讨论变化，而不需要经过一个层次指挥链的批准。你认识的人越多，你就越了解整个组织，你就越有能力提出新的想法并将其变成现实。在太阳液压，新员工在结束了制造生产线之旅后，却选择担任了一个跟他们当初被雇佣时不同的岗位角色，这并不罕见。他们偶然在组织内发现了自己的一个新兴趣点或一些更迫切的组织需要，而最终在不同的地方上任了。

    content: Why such a long induction? People at Sun believe it’s critical to build
      relationships with other employees across the company to understand it
      from all angles. A self-managing environment provides opportunity to make
      things happen, to freely reach out to colleagues, to discuss change
      without going through a hierarchy of approvals. The more people you know,
      the more you understand the whole, the more you’ll be able to come up with
      new ideas and turn them into reality. At Sun, it is not unusual, after the
      manufacturing tour, for new hires to take up a role that wasn’t the one
      they were hired for. They stumble upon a new interest or some urgent need
      and end up in a different place.
  - topic: Feedback and Performance Management
    title: Sun Hydraulics has developed a simple process for framing positive annual
      appraisals.
    content: >-
      [Sun Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics.com/) uses four simple
      statements in order to frame a positive discussion around performance:


      * State an admirable feature about the employee.

      * Ask what contributions they have made to Sun.

      * Ask what contributions they would like to make at Sun.

      * Ask how Sun can help them.


      Feedback about how individuals can improve is given in the natural course of events throughout the year and not saved up for the annual appraisal.^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 186]

    title: Sun Hydraulics dropped most formalities of project planning, thereby
      freeing up productive capacity.

      management is radically simplified. There is no management that wants to
      understand and control the complexity. Projects happen organically and
      informally. Engineers are typically working on several projects in
      parallel. They constantly rearrange their priorities, based on what they
      sense is the most important, most urgent, or most fun to do. Google has
      the famous practice of “20 percent time” - engineers are free to decide
      how to spend their Fridays. Sun and other self-managing organizations
      basically extend this to the whole week. There is no master plan. There
      are no project charters and no one bothers with staffing people on
      projects. Project teams form organically and disband again when work is
      done. Nobody knows if projects are on time or on budget, because for 90
      percent of the projects, no one cares to put a timeline on paper or to
      establish a budget. A huge amount of time is freed by dropping all the
      formalities of project planning - writing the plan, getting approval,
      reporting on progress, explaining variations, rescheduling, and
      re-estimating, not to mention the politics that go into securing resources
      for one’s project or to find someone to blame when projects are over time
      or over budget. When Kirsten Regal, one of Sun’s leaders, was asked about
      how little their meeting rooms seemed to be used, she quipped, “We don’t
      waste time being busy.^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations.

  - topic: Budgeting and Controlling
    title: An example of a budget-free approach of Sun Hydraulics, a publicly listed
      company in the United States
    content: >-
      The case of [Sun Hydraulics](https://www.sunhydraulics.com/) shows that a
      budget-free approach is possible even for a publicly listed company. Allen
      Carlson, the CEO, explains: "*After our IPO in January 1997, we had to get
      better at predicting our numbers. … The market penalized us when we missed
      one quarter in ‘99 after we adopted a new manufacturing system. We said,
      'Look, we can’t predict what’s going on in the economy, and we have no
      idea what our orders will look like a year from now. … We don’t run this
      business by the numbers. The numbers will be doing what the numbers will
      be doing; we can just give you a good picture of what the next quarter
      will bring.' So, we got away from making annual projections and started
      just doing quarterly forecasts. … We know our performance in the long run
      will be a result of just doing the right things every day."*


      \

      Most business leaders would feel naked without budgets and forecasts. When the question was put to Carlson "How do you deal with having no forecasts to compare people’s performance to? For instance, how do you know if the guys in Germany (where Sun has a plant) were doing a good job last year, if you have no target to compare against?"*,* his answer came shooting out of the barrel: *Who knows? Who cares? They are all working hard, doing the best they can. We have good people in all the places around the world and if I need that sort of scorecard I probably got the wrong person. That’s just the way we operate. … If I’m the head of sales of Sun in the US and you ask me what is the forecast, I have no clue! How could I generate one anyway? … At the end of the day, there is so much outside of your control. … It’s impossible to predict the unpredictable.*

    title: A public company since 1997 holds its commitment to Teal.
    content: "Sun Hydraulics, a company that was founded in 1970 by two engineers,
      designs and manufactures hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds. It has
      been a publicly owned company since 1997 with factories in Florida (where
      it is headquartered), Kansas, England, Germany, and Korea. Its shares are
      traded on NASDAQ, and as of June 1, 2016 Sun had a market capitalization
      of nearly $800 million. While the founder’s family still has a significant
      stake in Sun, they do not exercise majority control.^[As of March 1, 2016,
      Christine L. Koski, the daughter of the deceased founder of the Company,
      Robert E. Koski, is a member of the board of directors, and she, along
      with other family members, own or control approximately 14% of the
      outstanding shares of Sun’s common stock. Source: Sun Hydraulics
      Corporation 10-K filed March 31, 2016; p. 11.\r

      ] Sun would seem to be an important case of a company able to
      maintain a commitment to Teal despite a traditional corporate structure
      and a dispersed and fluid ownership. Maybe Teal organizations and non-Teal
      ownership can be compatible after all?"
