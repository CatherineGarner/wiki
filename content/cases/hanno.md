    title: 从算法到建议流程的开放式薪酬设置进化。
    content: >-
      #### 摘要


      2014年9月，汉诺向团队其他成员公开了所有团队成员的工资信息。


      在试用了一个基于算法的模型之后，截至2015年6月，汉诺已经采用了一个基于建议流程的自我设定式薪酬模型。用创始人乔恩·雷的话说：“只要我们在制定薪酬的过程中做到财务完全透明、尊重个人、同事评议和自律，就可以相信员工能为自己和团队设定一份合适的薪酬。^[[https://logbook.hanno.co/choose-your-own-salary/](https://hanno.co/blog/choose-your-own-salary/)]


      #### **Process for self-setting salaries at Hanno**


      It works roughly like this:


      * To ensure financial transparency, all salaries are published to the team (aka 'shipmates').

      * There is an open briefing every 3-6 months on Hanno's financial status, which advises 'shipmates' on salary direction for the coming period - advice they are at liberty to challenge or ignore.

      * This is followed by rounds of feedback and discussion, before each 'shipmate' submits their proposed salary for the next 3-6 months to an Advisory Process.

      * After further feedback and discussion, each 'shipmate' may adjust (or not) their original proposal.

      * The new salaries are then also published to the whole team.

      * A salary proposal can only be rejected if it is felt there is a genuine risk that it will harm the interests of the company.


      #### **Drawbacks of the algorithm model at Hanno**


      The previous algorithm-based system (based on the Buffer model) used addition/multiplication factors based on Role, Expertise, and Location, as well as a Founder component. Hanno soon found that this model was often either tricky to apply, or produced results that seemed to work against their goals.


      It was particularly difficult to adjust the weighting so that 'shipmates' were appropriately rewarded for both investing in personal growth (new skills/expertise) and delivering strategic business value (e.g. networking, business development). In addition, it proved difficult - in such a rigid model - to account for factors such as differing elements of Location, and to ensure that the company remained sufficiently attractive to 'shipmates' with dependents.


      In addition, the Founder factor was considered unfair (even by the founder himself), especially as this role had power over the salary formula itself and was therefore somewhat immune from checks and balances.


      #### **Further information**


      Details of this journey and its further evolution are documented in Hanno's online logbook.^\[Source: https://logbook.hanno.co/choose-your-own-salary/]
