## A new perspective

Starting with the Orange paradigm, businesses have become highly sophisticated at segmenting customers based on their conscious and unconscious needs, preferences and buying behaviors. Driven by the objective of outmaneuvering the competition, they carefully position their products and services for each segment. This has contributed importantly to the innovation brought about inOrangeandGreen, but increasingly, in our mature markets, it seems companies are bent on creating new needs over meeting existing ones. In this process, they often play on our fears and vanities. “Buy this and you will feel good about yourself.” “Buy this and others will like you.” “Buy this and you will be successful.”

In contrast, theTealapproach to marketing is rather simplistic and stems directly from the organization’s sense of purpose. Companies simply ‘listen in’ to what feels like the right offering. There is less emphasis on customer surveys and focus groups. Essentially, marketing boils down to:*This is our offer. At this moment, we feel this is the best we can possibly do. We hope you will like it.*In a strange paradox,Tealorganizations go about filling a need not by tuning in to the noise of the world (the surveys, the focus groups, the customer segmentation), but by listening within.*What product would we be really proud of? What product would fill a genuine need in the world?*These are the kinds of questions people inTealorganizations ask to define new products. It’s a process guided by beauty and intuition more than analytics.[\[1]](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Sales_and_Marketing#cite_note-1)
