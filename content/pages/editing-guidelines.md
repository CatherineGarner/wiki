The article below goes in details of what was established in 2015 when the wiki was started and is it continues to be the foundation of the wiki quality target.

**For organizations describing their practice as an illustration of a teal practice or behavior, the important things to remember are that the article needs to be :**

* **short (200 to 300 words)**
* **concrete, practical, actionable, helps readers to understand how this is happening in your organization reality**
* **using a neutral tone, no advertisement**

This is crowdsourced list of all quality criteria an article need to fulfill before we think it's ready for public consumption. The goal with this list is to aim for a high degree of quality, and to create consistency across the wiki.

All editors who do more than correcting simple typos should be familiar with this list. Please take time to read it so you join the editing spirit of the rest of this community. Welcome!
