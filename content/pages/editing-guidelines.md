The article below goes in details of what was established in 2015 when the wiki was started as editing guidelines. Today  it continues to be the foundation of the wiki quality target.

**For organizations describing their practice as an illustration of a teal practice or behavior, the important things to remember are that the article needs to be :**

* **short (200 to 300 words)**
* **concrete, practical, actionable, helping readers to understand how this is happening in your organization reality**
* **using a neutral tone, no advertisement**

This is a crowdsourced list of all quality criteria an article need to fulfill before we think it's ready for public consumption. The goal with this list is to aim for a high degree of quality, and to create consistency across the wiki.

All editors who do more than correcting simple typos should be familiar with this list. Please take time to read it so you join the editing spirit of the rest of this community. Welcome!

### What do Editors Do?

They do many things. Actually, we feel there are at least four types of editing roles: editing for structure, language, format and proofing. As an editor, you might choose to focus on only one of those (say systematically checking articles for format) or any combination of them. For instance, non-native English speakers might focus on structure and format. What about content? We feel everyone is a content editor by definition - if you see content that seems wrong or if you have additional insights to add, go for it. 

#### Editing with the advice process

As editors (just like any other roles) we are bound to the advice process. In practice, if you see a small edit, and you are kind of sure of what you are doing, then by any means just go an edit it. If on the other hand it's a big edit and you are unsure, then you can post the question and your preferred answer in the Trello board on the wiki team. 
*There are also people holding the role of "Upholder of the charter" (for the moment held by Chris Clark and Fred Laloux) that you can ask if you feel the question is touching on some fundaments of the wiki.*
