### Onboarding Reinventing Organizations Wiki contributors

1. Invite the person as member of the **Trello** Board <https://trello.com/b/a0Bm3Zed/rowiki-articles>

#### For content contributors (articles / cases)

On the CMS, we can update most of the content.
The Netlify Content Management System (CMS) supporting the Wiki edition is located here <https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/home>.

People will need to create an account there (Netlify admin need to validate this request). If there is delay in this process please raise a flag in Trello card <https://trello.com/c/Pjr2BioY>
