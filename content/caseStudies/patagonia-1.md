    title: Extend information flow throughout the market, incorporating suppliers
      and customers
    content: Patagonia has gone beyond the boundaries of the organization with its
      "Footprint Chronicles". Information transparency has been extended to
      suppliers and customers. Customers can see where everthing is made, how it
      is made, what the conditions are like, what the impact of transportation
      and water usage is on the overall carbon footprint. A major part of the
      organization's purpose is served by employing this radical degree of
      honesty with regard to information and information flow when dealing with
      outside parties. Information exchange with suppliers and customers via
      email and internet is used to fuel continous improvement.
