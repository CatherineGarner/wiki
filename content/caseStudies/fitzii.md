    content: "Fitzii is organized in three parallel teams along functional lines –
      product & development, sales & marketing, and hiring success. Each has a
      senior person who plays a strategy and planning role but has no authority
      over other team members (Fitzii uses the advice process and other
      peer-based processes for decision making).\r

      \r

      Fitzii maintains a Venn diagram to show the relationship between its
      three teams. Each team is responsible for its own plans; every combination
      of two teams has shared plans where their work overlaps; and finally,
      certain topics rest in the center of the Venn where any changes require
      input from all three teams. “Center of the Venn” topics include Fitzii’s
      evolutionary purpose, strategy and thematic goals, product and service
      changes that could significantly affect customers, and people and culture
      practices such as self-management."
