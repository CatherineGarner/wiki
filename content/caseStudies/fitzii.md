  - topic: Organizational Structure
    content: "Fitzii is organized in three parallel teams along functional lines –
      product & development, sales & marketing, and hiring success. Each has a
      senior person who plays a strategy and planning role but has no authority
      over other team members (Fitzii uses the advice process and other
      peer-based processes for decision making).\r

      \r

      Fitzii maintains a Venn diagram to show the relationship between its
      three teams. Each team is responsible for its own plans; every combination
      of two teams has shared plans where their work overlaps; and finally,
      certain topics rest in the center of the Venn where any changes require
      input from all three teams. “Center of the Venn” topics include Fitzii’s
      evolutionary purpose, strategy and thematic goals, product and service
      changes that could significantly affect customers, and people and culture
      practices such as self-management."

      illustrate where teams overlap and share decision making
  - topic: Meetings
    title: Fitzii uses a variety of regular meetings and traditional and innovative
      meeting practices to encourage team-building, information-sharing, and
      decision-making.
    content: "In addition to as-needed meetings, Fitzii uses regular meeting
      practices.\r

      \r

      Monthly whole team meetings – all regular Fitzii coworkers attend a
      monthly meeting that alternates between its two offices. For a team who
      work from two locations and often telework, this ensures one predictable
      occasion to meet together face-to-face. The agenda regularly includes
      wholeness activities such as a getting-to-know one coworker activity, as
      well as financial review to increase the financial awareness of every team
      member and promote ownership thinking. Other topics are added, to a shared
      document (no one person controls the agenda), by anyone who wants the
      whole team’s input on any topic.\r

      \r

      One-on-one meetings – traditional manager-employee one-on-one
      meetings have been replaced with rotating one-on-one meetings between
      random pairings of individuals. These meetings, called “Teal Dates”, serve
      to strengthen bonds, increase understanding of other roles, and provide a
      predictable first point of contact for the advice process. Each Teal Date
      pairing lasts three months.\r

      \r

      Generally, sound meeting practices and facilitation are highly
      valued, ex. De Bono techniques, task-based learning techniques, and the
      company’s own Doozy of a Question (DOAQ) meeting style are examples."
  - topic: Coordination
    title: Key to Fitzii’s coordination is a weekly update on the company’s social
      network
    content: >-
      At [Fitzii](https://www.fitzii.com/go/about/), weekly updates take place
      in an enterprise social network, called Yammer, which is key for sharing
      information and receiving advice. Every core team member writes a weekly
      update of her/his work activities, advice processes, and concerns.


      Fitzii’s weekly updates are essential to its communication. Weekly updates ensure every team member has regular access to a wide variety of information about the business – everything from financial performance to customer concerns and the personal engagement of the individual – resulting in increased alignment and engagement of Fitzii team members. Fitzii’s ownership and advisory board are also members of the Yammer group, and they occasionally add comments of encouragement or raise difficult questions within the weekly updates or at advisory board meetings.
