    title: AES uses the practice of a survey to stimulate discussions about values
      and ground rules.
    content: "Annual survey: Many organizations cultivate discussion about values
      and ground rules through an annual survey. At [AES](http://www.aes.com/),
      for instance, a task force of volunteers devised a new set of questions
      every year and sent them out to the entire organization. Each unit had the
      obligation— it was one of the ground rules— to discuss the outcome of the
      survey, in whatever format it thought would be useful."
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: At AES, candidates are invited to discussions about the organization’s
      values and practices during the recruitment process.
    content: 'An employee of [AES](https://www.ase.com/Home.aspx) explained: "bad
      hire" is someone who is a chronic complainer, who is not happy, who blames
      others, who doesn’t take responsibility, who’s not honest, who doesn’t
      trust other people. A bad hire would be someone who needs specific
      direction and waits to be told what to do. A poor hire would be someone
      who wasn’t flexible and who says, “It’s not my job.”'
  - topic: Environmental and Social Management
    title: "Via the advice process, AES employees initiate environmental and social
      initiatives. "
    content: "For AES, environmental and social initiatives start with inner
      rightness. Here is how AES expressed it in a public filing with the U.S.
      Securities and Exchange Commission when it offered stock to the public:
      \"An important element of AES is its commitment to four major 'shared'
      values ^[one of which is Social Responsibility, which triggered AES’s
      decision to plant trees]. If the company perceives a conflict between
      these values and profits, it will try to adhere to its values ― even if
      doing so might result in diminished profits or foregone opportunities.
      Moreover, the Company seeks to adhere to these values not as a means to
      achieve economic success, but because adherence is a worthwhile goal in
      and of itself.\"\r

      \r

      AES planted millions of trees to offset carbon emissions. This idea
      came from an employee in in Los Angeles, not the senior team. Initially
      there was no budget for this. Using the advice process, she built support
      for the money AES should put into tree planting. ^[Source: Laloux,
      Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), pages 160-172]"
  - topic: Strategy
    title: Strategic decisions can be made by anyone, often through an advice process.
    content: "A recently hired financial analyst at AES informed the CEO, Dennis
      Bakke, that he was intending to leave his role to go back to his native
      Pakistan and research the opportunity for electricity-generating capacity
      there on behalf of AES. Bakke expressed skepticism, telling him that
      despite encouragement from the U.S. Department of State to expand into
      Pakistan several years earlier, they declined due to concern over high
      levels of corruption there.\r

      \r

      Despite the CEO’s recommendation, the analyst decided to go to
      Pakistan, effectively creating a new position for himself as business
      developer, retaining his previous salary. Six months later, he invited
      Bakke to Pakistan to meet the prime minister. Two and a half years later,
      a $ 700 million power plant was running.^[ Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  - topic: Purchasing and Investments
    title: AES provides its workers a high level of autonomy in their area of
      expertise which enables them to negotiate multi-million dollar plant
      investments. Interdisciplinary volunteer task forces supported by a few
      people from headquarters with relevant expertise collectively do budget
      planning and auditing.
    content: "Like their counterparts at [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) and [Sun
      Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics/), teams at
      [AES](http://www.ase.com/) were responsible for decisions relating to all
      aspects of day-to-day operations including investment related budgeting,
      hiring, training, evaluations, compensation, capital expenditures, and
      purchasing, as well as long-term strategy and charitable giving.
      [AES](http://www.ase.com/) is an energy provider, operating thermal and
      hydroelectric power plants as well as electrical grids. This equipment is
      absolutely central to the lives of many people and businesses. A
      front-page article in the Wall Street Journal by reporter Alex Markels
      illustrates with a story how far teams at [AES](http://www.ase.com/) went
      with taking on responsibilities typically handled by headquarters:


      \\

      *MONTVILLE, Conn. –– His hands still blackened from coal he has just
      unloaded from a barge, Jeff Hatch picks up the phone and calls his
      favorite broker. “What kind of rate can you give me for $10 million at 30
      days?” he asks the agent, who handles Treasury bills. “Only 6.09? But I
      just got a 6.13 quote from Chase.” In another room, Joe Oddo is working on
      J.P. Morgan & Co. “6.15 at 30 days?” confirms Mr. Oddo, a maintenance
      technician at AES Corp.’s power plant here. “I’ll get right back to you.”
      Members of an ad-hoc team that manages a $33 million plant investment
      fund, Messrs. Oddo and Hatch quickly confer with their associates, then
      close the deal. … It sounds like “empowerment” gone mad. Give workers more
      autonomy in their area of expertise? Sure. Open the books to employee
      purview? Perhaps. But what good could possibly come from handing corporate
      finance duties to workers whose collective borrowing experience totals a
      mortgage, two car loans, and some paid-off credit-card debt? Plenty of
      good, says AES. … “The more you increase individual responsibility, the
      better the chances for incremental improvements in operations,” argues
      Dennis W. Bakke, the company’s chief executive and one of its founders. …
      “And more importantly” he says “it makes work a lot more fun.” Is giving
      coal handlers investment responsibility risky? Mr. Bakke thinks not. He
      notes that the volunteer team in Montville does have a financial adviser,
      and they work within a narrow range of investment choices. They aren’t
      exactly buying derivatives. What the CEO likes about the arrangement is
      that “they’re changed people by this experience. They’ve learned so much
      about the total aspect of the business, they’ll never be the same.”*
      ^[Alex Markels, \"Blank Check,\" The Wall Street Journal, April 9, 1998)]

      At AES, every team established its investment budget once a year.
      Budgets would be added up at the plant level, sometimes running as high as
      $300 million in a year. When teams were satisfied with the consolidated
      budget for the plant, it was reviewed, together with those from all other
      plants, by a budget task force that would suggest possible changes and
      improvements (but didn’t have power to enforce changes). That task force
      was staffed with a few people from headquarters with relevant expertise,
      but predominantly with people from local units with all sorts of
      backgrounds - a security guard could sit next to a technician and an
      engineer. Internal audits were performed in the same way, by volunteer
      task forces: each plant would be audited by colleagues from other
      plants.\r

      \r

      AES found out that using voluntary task forces instead of fixed
      staff functions has multiple benefits. Employees find avenues to express
      talents and gifts that their primary role might not call for. They develop
      a true sense of ownership and responsibility when they see they have real
      power to shape their company. Founder Dennis Bakke insists on another
      point: these task forces are formidable learning institutions. At any
      point in time, thousands of people would be involved in task forces,
      picking up technical and leadership skills from more experienced
      colleagues. It’s a modern-day form of apprenticeship, scaled to a massive
      level. No classroom training could ever provide the amount of learning
      that was taking place day in and day out in the voluntary task
      forces.^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker
      (2014), page 88 and following]"
  - topic: Crisis Management
    title: AES suspends the advice process as gracefully as possible
    content: "In fall of 2001, after the terrorist attacks and the collapse of
      Enron, AES’s stock price plummeted. The company needed access to capital
      markets to serve its high debt levels but found them suddenly closed.
      Swift and drastic action was needed to prevent bankruptcy. A critical
      question was: how many and which power plants would need to be sold off to
      raise the necessary cash? With 40,000 people spread around the world,
      Dennis Bakke, the CEO, could hardly convene everybody and stand on a
      soapbox like Zobrist at FAVI. And the problem was so complex that he
      couldn’t simply send out a blog post with two alternatives, like Jos de
      Blok did at Buurtzorg.\r

      \r

      Bakke chose a course of action that temporarily suspended the advice
      process in a way that nevertheless minimized the risk of under-mining
      trust in self-management. He didn’t work out a plan behind closed doors
      with his management team; instead, he publicly announced that top-down
      decision-making would be made during a limited time for a limited number
      of decisions, albeit critical ones. The advice process would remain in
      force for all other decisions. To investigate the best course of action
      and make the tough calls, Bakke appointed Bill Luraschi, a young and
      brilliant general counsel. Luraschi wasn’t regarded as one of the most
      senior leaders nor as someone who would seek a leading role in the future.
      The signal was clear: the senior leaders of the organization were not
      looking to exert more power. Top-down decision-making would be handled by
      someone with no thirst for power, and it really would be temporary.\r

      \r

      If the advice process needs to be suspended in times of crisis,
      these two guidelines can serve to maintain trust in self-management: give
      full transparency about the scope and timeframe of top-down
      decision-making, and appoint someone to make those decisions who will not
      be suspected of continuing to exert such powers when the crisis is over. "
  - topic: Fundamental Assumptions
    title: "During transition, two sets of belief systems were opposed to each
      other: the traditional Amber/Orange belief system and the new set,
      regarding self-management the logical way to operate. The traditional
      belief set was made explicit together with the colleagues, which made it
      very powerful and confrontational."

      Here is how Dennis Bakke (CEO of AES at that time) summarizes the
      assumptions workers feel bosses have about them:


      * Workers are lazy. If they are not watched, they will not work diligently.

      * Workers work primarily for money. They will do what it takes to make as much money as possible.

      * Workers put their own interest ahead of what is best for the organization. They are selfish.

      * Workers perform best and are most effective if they have one simple repeatable task to accomplish.

      * Workers are not capable of making good decisions about important matters that affect the economic performance of the company. Bosses are good at making decisions.

      * Workers do not want to be responsible for their actions or for decisions that affect the performance of the organization.

      * Workers need care and protection, just as children need the care of their parents.

      * Workers should be compensated by the hour or by the number of "pieces" produced. Bosses should be paid a salary and possibly receive bonuses and stock.

      * Workers are like interchangeable parts of machines. One "good" worker is pretty much the same as another "good" worker.

      * Workers need to be told what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. Bosses need to hold them accountable.


      And here are the new assumptions :


      AES people :


      * Are creative, thoughtful, trustworthy adults, capable of making important decisions;

      * Are accountable and responsible for their decisions and actions;

      * Are fallible. We make mistakes, sometimes on purpose;

      * Are unique and

      * Want to use their talents and skills to make a positive contribution to the organization and the world.
