    title: AES uses the practice of a survey to stimulate discussions about values
      and ground rules.
    content: "Annual survey: Many organizations cultivate discussion about values
      and ground rules through an annual survey. At [AES](http://www.aes.com/),
      for instance, a task force of volunteers devised a new set of questions
      every year and sent them out to the entire organization. Each unit had the
      obligation— it was one of the ground rules— to discuss the outcome of the
      survey, in whatever format it thought would be useful."
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: At AES, candidates are invited to discussions about the organization’s
      values and practices during the recruitment process.
    content: 'An employee of [AES](https://www.ase.com/Home.aspx) explained: "bad
      hire" is someone who is a chronic complainer, who is not happy, who blames
      others, who doesn’t take responsibility, who’s not honest, who doesn’t
      trust other people. A bad hire would be someone who needs specific
      direction and waits to be told what to do. A poor hire would be someone
      who wasn’t flexible and who says, “It’s not my job.”'
  - topic: Environmental and Social Management
    title: "Via the advice process, AES employees initiate environmental and social
      initiatives. "
    content: "For AES, environmental and social initiatives start with inner
      rightness. Here is how AES expressed it in a public filing with the U.S.
      Securities and Exchange Commission when it offered stock to the public:
      \"An important element of AES is its commitment to four major 'shared'
      values ^[one of which is Social Responsibility, which triggered AES’s
      decision to plant trees]. If the company perceives a conflict between
      these values and profits, it will try to adhere to its values ― even if
      doing so might result in diminished profits or foregone opportunities.
      Moreover, the Company seeks to adhere to these values not as a means to
      achieve economic success, but because adherence is a worthwhile goal in
      and of itself.\"\r

      \r

      AES planted millions of trees to offset carbon emissions. This idea
      came from an employee in in Los Angeles, not the senior team. Initially
      there was no budget for this. Using the advice process, she built support
      for the money AES should put into tree planting. ^[Source: Laloux,
