    title: AES uses the practice of a survey to stimulate discussions about values
      and ground rules.
    content: "Annual survey: Many organizations cultivate discussion about values
      and ground rules through an annual survey. At [AES](http://www.aes.com/),
      for instance, a task force of volunteers devised a new set of questions
      every year and sent them out to the entire organization. Each unit had the
      obligation— it was one of the ground rules— to discuss the outcome of the
      survey, in whatever format it thought would be useful."
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: At AES, candidates are invited to discussions about the organization’s
      values and practices during the recruitment process.
    content: 'An employee of [AES](https://www.ase.com/Home.aspx) explained: "bad
      hire" is someone who is a chronic complainer, who is not happy, who blames
      others, who doesn’t take responsibility, who’s not honest, who doesn’t
      trust other people. A bad hire would be someone who needs specific
      direction and waits to be told what to do. A poor hire would be someone
      who wasn’t flexible and who says, “It’s not my job.”'
