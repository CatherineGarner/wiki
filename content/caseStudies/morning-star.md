    title: At Morning Star, every management practice is inspired by two basic
      social values.
    content: "The founding principles for [Morning
      Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/)'s way of operating were set early in
      its history. When the first tomato processing factory was built, Chris
      Rufer and the company’s first employees met to define how they wanted to
      work together. They decided that two principles, two basic social values,
      should inspire every management practice at Morning Star: individuals
      should never use force against other people and they should honor their
      commitments . These principles are at the heart of the company’s conflict
      resolution mechanism, a process that is described in great detail in the
      “Colleague Principles,” a core document outlining Morning Star’s self-
      managing practices."
  - topic: Coordination
    title: At Morning Star, colleagues coordinate both ad hoc and through written
      annual agreements.
    content: "Colleagues at Morningstar noticed that lots of people were buying
      threadlocker (an adhesive that prevents nuts and bolts from accidentally
      loosening) in dozens of different formats and from different vendors. They
      were not only losing out on volume discounts, but the uncoordinated
      purchasing also generated unnecessary bureaucracy because regulations in
      the food industry required workers to track every format in a Material
      Safety Data Sheet. A worker suggested that he could walk around the plant
      once a quarter to coordinate orders. A similar solution emerged for
      purchasing packaging materials where volume discounts can quickly add
      up.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to
      Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness
      (Kindle Locations 2394-2395). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]\r

      Another key mechanism for coordination at Morningstar is the
      Colleague Letter of Understanding (or simply CLOU). See “Role Definition
      and Allocation”/”Concrete examples for inspiration”/”Morningstar”."
  - topic: Role Definition and Allocation
    title: A formal process for defining and allocating roles which takes place once
      each year
    content: >-
      As a Morning Star colleague, you write a personal mission statement
      (“Personal Commercial Mission” in Morning Star’s language) and spell out
      all of the roles you commit to perform in a document called the Colleague
      Letter of Understanding (or simply CLOU). Roles at Morning Star are
      defined very specifically, so you might well hold 20 or 30 different roles
      (one might be receiver of tomatoes at the unloading station, another might
      be trainer of seasonal whole peel sorters). For each role, you specify;


      * what it does,

      * what authority you believe you should have (act, recommend, decide, or a combination thereof),

      * what indicators will help you understand if you are doing a good job, and

      * what improvements you hope to make on those indicators.


      In a continuous process like Morning Star’s, each person in the chain receives tomatoes or paste in some form from someone upstream and delivers them in another form to someone downstream. This might explain why colleagues at Morning Star chose to discuss the CLOUs, once written or updated, not in a team setting but in a series of one-on-one discussions with colleagues up and downstream. 


      Here is a [sample CLOU document](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/index.php?action=ajax&title=-&rs=SecureFileStore::getFile&f=/a/a9/MorningStar_Sample2011_CLOU.pdf). A more detailed discussions of CLOUs can be found [here](http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments).^\[Source: http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments]
