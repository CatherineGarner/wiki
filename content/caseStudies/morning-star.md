    title: At Morning Star, every management practice is inspired by two basic
      social values.
    content: "The founding principles for Morning Star's way of operating were set
      early in its history. When the first tomato processing factory was built,
      Chris Rufer and the company’s first employees met to define how they
      wanted to work together. They decided that two principles, two basic
      social values, should inspire every management practice at Morning Star:
      individuals should never use force against other people and they should
      honor their commitments . These principles are at the heart of the
      company’s conflict resolution mechanism, a process that is described in
      great detail in the “Colleague Principles,” a core document outlining
      Morning Star’s self- managing practices."
