    title: At Morning Star, every management practice is inspired by two basic
      social values.
    content: "The founding principles for [Morning
      Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/)'s way of operating were set early in
      its history. When the first tomato processing factory was built, Chris
      Rufer and the company’s first employees met to define how they wanted to
      work together. They decided that two principles, two basic social values,
      should inspire every management practice at Morning Star: individuals
      should never use force against other people and they should honor their
      commitments . These principles are at the heart of the company’s conflict
      resolution mechanism, a process that is described in great detail in the
      “Colleague Principles,” a core document outlining Morning Star’s self-
      managing practices."
  - topic: Coordination
    title: At Morning Star, colleagues coordinate both ad hoc and through written
      annual agreements.
    content: >-
      Colleagues at Morningstar noticed that lots of people were buying
      threadlocker (an adhesive that prevents nuts and bolts from accidentally
      loosening) in dozens of different formats and from different vendors. They
      were not only losing out on volume discounts, but the uncoordinated
      purchasing also generated unnecessary bureaucracy because regulations in
      the food industry required workers to track every format in a Material
      Safety Data Sheet. A worker suggested that he could walk around the plant
      once a quarter to coordinate orders. A similar solution emerged for
      purchasing packaging materials where volume discounts can quickly add
      up.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to
      Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness
      (Kindle Locations 2394-2395). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


      Another key mechanism for coordination at Morningstar is the Colleague Letter of Understanding (or simply CLOU). See “[Role Definition and Allocation](../role-definition-and-allocation/)" and then Concrete examples for inspiration”/”Morningstar”.
  - topic: Role Definition and Allocation
    title: A formal process for defining and allocating roles which takes place once
      each year
    content: >-
      As a Morning Star colleague, you write a personal mission statement
      (“Personal Commercial Mission” in Morning Star’s language) and spell out
      all of the roles you commit to perform in a document called the Colleague
      Letter of Understanding (or simply CLOU). Roles at Morning Star are
      defined very specifically, so you might well hold 20 or 30 different roles
      (one might be receiver of tomatoes at the unloading station, another might
      be trainer of seasonal whole peel sorters). For each role, you specify;


      * what it does,

      * what authority you believe you should have (act, recommend, decide, or a combination thereof),

      * what indicators will help you understand if you are doing a good job, and

      * what improvements you hope to make on those indicators.


      In a continuous process like Morning Star’s, each person in the chain receives tomatoes or paste in some form from someone upstream and delivers them in another form to someone downstream. This might explain why colleagues at Morning Star chose to discuss the CLOUs, once written or updated, not in a team setting but in a series of one-on-one discussions with colleagues up and downstream. 


      Here is a [sample CLOU document](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/index.php?action=ajax&title=-&rs=SecureFileStore::getFile&f=/a/a9/MorningStar_Sample2011_CLOU.pdf). A more detailed discussions of CLOUs can be found [here](http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments).^\[Source: http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments]
  - topic: Conflict resolution
    title: Use a conflict resolution process called the “Direct Communication and
      Gaining Agreement”, which supports parties in finding agreement. Mediators
      may be called in for support, but they cannot impose a resolution from
      above.
    content: "Within Morning Star, there are 23 teams (called Business Units), but
      no management positions and no HR department. Colleagues operate entirely
      on self-managing principles that were established early in its history .
      When the first tomato processing factory was built, Chris Rufer and the
      company’s first employees met to define how they wanted to work together.
      They decided that two basic social values should inspire every management
      practice at Morning Star: individuals should never use force against other
      people and they should honor their commitments. These values are at the
      heart of the company’s conflict resolution process, which is described in
      great detail in the “Colleague Principles”. This is a core document
      outlining Morning Star’s self-managing practices. The conflict resolution
      process (called “Direct Communication and Gaining Agreement”), applies to
      any type of disagreement. This could be a difference of opinion about a
      technical decision, an interpersonal conflict or a breach of values.
      Specifically, it can be used in performance issues when one colleague
      believes that another is not pulling his weight.\r

      \r

      Whatever the topic, the process starts with one person asking
      another to gain agreement: In a first phase, they sit together and try to
      sort it out privately. The initiator has to make a clear request (not a
      judgment, not a demand), and the other person has to respond clearly to
      the request (with a “yes,” a “no,” or a counterproposal).\r

      \r

      If they can’t find a solution agreeable to both of them, they
      nominate a colleague they both trust to act as a mediator. The colleague
      supports the parties in finding agreement but cannot impose a
      resolution.\r

      \r

      If mediation fails, a panel of topic-relevant colleagues is
      convened. The panel’s role, again, is to listen and help shape agreement.
      It cannot force a decision, but usually carries enough moral weight for
      matters to come to a conclusion.\r

      \r

      In an ultimate step, Chris Rufer, the founder and president, can be
      called into the panel, to further reinforce the panel’s moral weight.
      Since the disagreement is private, all parties are expected to respect
      confidentiality during and after the processes. Of course, this
      confidentiality also applies to the two persons at the heart of the
      conflict. They must resolve their disagreement between themselves and are
      discouraged from spreading the conflict by enlisting support and building
      rival factions."
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: Recruitment in Morning Star is a very demanding process, generally
      including a multitude of interviews and a battery of diagnostics.
    content: "Chris Rufer, the founder of Morning Star, estimates that, on average,
      it takes a new associate a year or more to become fully functional in the
      self-management environment. When the company was smaller, Chris Rufer
      spent half a day interviewing every prospective employee, usually in the
      candidate’s home. The bulk of the conversation focused on assessing the
      fit between Morning Star’s philosophy and the applicant’s expectations.
      Today every potential hire gets a two-hour introduction to self-
      management and is interviewed by 10 to 12 Morning Star colleagues. Even
      then, mistakes happen. Paul Green Jr., co-founder,  estimates that as many
      as 50% of seasoned hires leave within two years because they have a hard
      time adapting to the self management system. \r

      \r

      A colleague who wants to expand a Business Unit’s pay-roll must sell
      the idea to his or her peers, who will ask for a job description and a
      business case. If there’s a consensus to move ahead, the mechanics of
      recruiting will get turned over to an in-house specialist.\r

      \r

      Emphasis is on fit for role and fit for the organization.  A major
      point in fit for organization is passion for learning."
  - topic: Commitment, Working Hours and Flexibility
    title: Each colleague at Morning Star has a work schedule commitment.
    content: The work schedule commitment captures how many hours a person can
      commit to work during low and high season (when the tomatoes are harvested
      and processed), providing a clear basis on which colleagues can discuss
      and manage their time collectively whilst still fulfilling the
      organization’s purpose. The work schedule commitment is captured in
      [Morning Star](https://www.morningstarco.com/)’s colleague letter of
      understanding or CLOU, which also includes a personal mission statement
      and detailed information about the roles a person currently commits to, as
      well as improvements they hope to make. This more formal way of capturing
      commitment plays to Morning Star's need for continuous improvement to
      increase efficiency as it is essentially a low-margin, commodity
      business^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker
      (2014), page 182-183].
  - topic: Objectives and Target Setting
    title: In Morning Star, colleagues give each other an undertaking to deliver
      certain volumes, since each section is dependent on the output of the
      preceding section to deliver its output.
    content: "As a Morning Star colleague, you write a personal mission statement
      (“Personal Commercial Mission” in Morning Star’s language) and spell out
      all of the roles you commit to in a document called Colleague Letter of
      Understanding (or simply CLOU). Roles at Morning Star are defined very
      specifically, so you might well hold 20 or 30 different roles (one might
      be receiver of tomatoes at the unloading station, another might be trainer
      of seasonal whole peel sorters). For each role, you specify what it does,
      what authority you believe you should have (act, recommend, decide, or a
      combination thereof), what indicators will help you understand if you are
      doing a good job, and what improvements you hope to make on those
      indicators.\r

      \r

      Why this level of formality and granularity? In a continuous process
      like Morning Star’s, each person in the chain receives tomatoes or paste
      in some form from someone upstream and delivers them in another form to
      someone downstream. Therefore, colleagues at Morning Star chose to discuss
      the CLOUs, once written or updated, not in a team setting (which most
      self-managing organizations do), but in a series of one-on-one discussions
      with the handful of colleagues up and down-stream that people interact
      with most. People discuss and negotiate what’s written in each other’s
      CLOU documents very seriously— they want to make sure that people upstream
      commit to supplying them with the right input, so that they can in turn
      deliver to people downstream what they committed to.\r

      \r

      Colleagues at Morning Star set themselves targets for their part of
      the process, to stimulate continuous improvement. They measure indicators,
      compare them to the self-set targets, analyze root causes, and experiment
      with new ideas. These targets are mostly set at a local level, for one
      machine or one process step, where the outcomes can be predicted with some
      certainty."
