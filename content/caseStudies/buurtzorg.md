introduction: "**Buurtzorg Nederland** is a Dutch home-care organization which
  has attracted international attention for its innovative use of independent
  nurse teams in delivering relatively low-cost care. Buurtzorg is Dutch for
  “neighborhood care”.


  **History**


  It was founded in 2006 in the small city of Almelo by Jos de Blok and a
  small team of professional nurses who were dissatisfied with the delivery of
  health care by traditional home care organizations in the Netherlands.
  According to Sharda S. Nandram, the company has created a new management
  approach: “integrating simplification,” characterized by a simple, flat
  organizational structure through which a wide range of services, facilitated
  by information technology, can be provided.\r

      organization only 45 people work at the head office and there is no
      marketing department. In fact, since the organization was started in 2007
      they have not used any conventional marketing at all. From the beginning
      Buurtzorg focused on patients and on solving problems.


      "We believed this would create a better result. We would not use any marketing, instead use free publicity when people were satisfied with our services.", says Jos de Blok. Today Buurtzorg work a lot on establishing close and genuine relationships with patients, different stakeholders and other people with a natural interest in their services. Because of the success of the organization, this also includes communication with media and newspapers in an effort to meet the interest that has been generated by many years of good word of mouth. "Buurtzorg has become associated with something “good” now, so it is easier for us nowadays.", says Jos de Blok.
