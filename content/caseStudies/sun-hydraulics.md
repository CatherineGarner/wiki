    title: An internal recruitment process in which future colleagues interview
      candidates for a role.
    content: "At Sun Hydraulics, minor role changes often take place organically, by
      people simply stepping up to take on a role or opening a conversation
      about the need for someone to take on that role.\r

      \r

      When a larger role is created or an existing set of roles becomes
      available (say there is a need for an automation engineer), an internal
      recruitment process takes place.  Candidates are interviewed by the
      colleagues who will work most closely with the person filling the new
      role."
