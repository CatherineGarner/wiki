    title: At BerylHealth an e-mail sent to the whole workforce recognizing and
      thanking someone encourages others to follow and creates the so-called
      “Good Stuff Friday” for everyone.
    content: "BerylHealth has come up with a variation of the ESBZ's practice. But
      instead of gathering together, a mass email chain always erupts at some
      point on Friday afternoon. (Hence the name the practice has taken: “Good
      Stuff Friday”.).\r

      \r

      One colleague sends an email to the entire workforce recognizing and
      thanking another colleague or department for something that happened that
      week, or simply to share some good news.\r

      \r

      The first email invariably triggers a whole avalanche of thanking
      and recognition. This practice builds community and closes the week in a
      spirit of appreciation and gratitude."
