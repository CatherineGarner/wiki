    title: Sending love to clients
    content: "Through a process of collective discussion, FAVI’s employees
      determined the organization had two reasons for existence, two fundamental
      purposes: the first to provide meaningful work in the area of Hallencourt,
      a rural area in northern France where good work is rare; the second to
      give and receive love from clients. Yes, love, a word rarely heard in the
      world of business, and even more unexpected in a blue-collar manufacturing
      environment. At FAVI, it has taken on real meaning. Operators don’t just
      send products to their clients, they send products into which they have
      put their heart. A few years ago, around Christmas time, an operator at
      FAVI molded excess brass into a few small figurines of Santa and of
      reindeers. He added the figurines into the boxes of finished products,
      rather like kids put a message in a bottle they throw out to sea,
      imagining that someone, somewhere, would find it. Other operators have
      since picked up on the idea and at random times of the year add brass
      figurines into their shipments, as little tokens of love to their
      counterparts working on assembly lines at Volkswagen or Volvo, who will
      find the figurines when they unpack the boxes.^\\[Laloux, Frederic

  - topic: Organizational Structure
    title: FAVI employs a customer-based parallel team structure with supporting teams
    content: "FAVI’s factory has more than 500 employees that are organized in 21
      teams called “mini-factories” of 15 to 35 people. Most of the teams are
      dedicated to a specific customer or customer type (the Volkswagen team,
      the Audi team, the Volvo team, and so forth). There are a few upstream
      production teams (the foundry team, the mold repair team, maintenance),
      and support teams (engineering, quality, lab, administration, and sales
      support). Each team self-organizes; there is no middle management, and
      there are virtually no rules or procedures other than those that the teams
      decide upon themselves. The staff functions have nearly all disappeared.
      The former HR, planning, scheduling, engineering, production-IT and
      purchasing departments have all been shut down. Their tasks have been
      taken over by the operators in the teams, who do their own hiring,
      purchasing, planning, and scheduling. The sales department has been
      disbanded too. The sales account manager for Audi is now part of the Audi
      team, just as the sales account manager for Volvo is part of the Volvo
      team. There is no head of sales above the group of account managers. In
      the old structure, white-collar workers in offices with windows
      overlooking the shop floor planned in detail what the workers needed to
      do, by when, and how. Now blue-collar workers effectively wear their own
      white collars and no longer receive instructions from above.^[Laloux,

  - topic: Coordination
    title: At FAVI, coordination happens organically on a voluntary basis through
      regular meetings, temporary project teams and reverse delegation.
    content: "At FAVI, production is organized by customer. This makes
      load-balancing a significant issue: because customer orders fluctuate, on
      any given day some teams might have too much work and others too little.
      Rather than employing a COO or staff planner to make decisions about
      allocating work across teams, FAVI chose a more organic and elegant
      solution. At regular intervals, a group composed of one designated person
      from each team comes together for a few minutes; they quickly discuss
      which teams are over or understaffed; back in their teams, they ask for
      volunteers to switch teams for a shift or two. The person from the Audi
      team, for example, might ask who in the team is willing to spend the day
      with the Volvo team. Things happen organically on a voluntary basis;
      nobody is being allocated to a team by a higher authority.^[Laloux,
      Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating
      Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle

  - topic: Information Flow
    title: Information flow in time of crisis.
    content: "When Jean-Francois Zobrist, the CEO of FAVI, was faced with difficult
      and critical decisions at the company, he readily admitted he needed help
      to find a good answer. More than once, on impulse, he went around the shop
      floor, asked everybody to stop the machines, climbed on a soapbox and
      shared his problem with all employees, trying to figure out a course of
      action.\r

      \r

      In time of crisis, he openly shared information with all employees
      about the reality of the situation, trusting them to handle it. As a
      result, employees did not retain a false sense of safety. Everybody,
      regardless of any rank, could take the opportunity to sense the impact of
      the information offered and resonate to it. People in the audience shouted
      questions and proposals. Together they found a collective course of action
      to overcome the crisis."
  - topic: Meetings
    title: A rhythm of meetings to suit manufacturing.
    content: >-
      Weekly senior management meetings in [Favi](http://www.favi.com/) used to
      include the heads of sales, production, maintenance, finance, HR, etc.
      These are now held at the team level.  


      Teams hold short regular meetings to align and make decisions as follows:


      * a short tactical discussion at the start of every shift

      * a weekly meeting with the sales account manager to discuss orders

      * a monthly meeting with an open agenda


      Beyond that, they tend to have no regularly scheduled meetings at all. If cross-team meetings occur, it’s in response to a specific need.
  - topic: Mood Management
    title: "FAVI had a beautiful practice of gratitude and celebration: every
      meeting in the company started with a round where each participant in turn
      shared a brief story of someone they had recently thanked or
      congratulated."
    content: "This powerful practice start of the meeting at FAVI had a telling
      effect on meetings: it nourished moods of possibility, gratitude,
      celebration, and trust. Focusing on others and their accomplishments
      shifts focus away from the personal preoccupations members might have
      brought to the meeting. After a few years, this practice started feeling
      staid to people at FAVI, and was dropped. It might show up again, perhaps
      in another form. Such practices evolve. They should feel fresh and
      meaningful, not formal and fixed. "
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: Uses an extended trial period, to ensure a mutual match.
    content: "[FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) made extended use of the trial period for
      both parties to test whether the match works out."
  - topic: Onboarding
    title: FAVI newly hired engineers and administrative workers are trained at
      operating at least one machine on the shop floor.  New hires also end
      their onboarding process writing a free format open letter to the group of
      colleagues they have joined, frequently expressing joy and gratitude.
    content: >-
      At [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/), the French automotive supplier, all
      engineers and administrative workers have been trained to operate at least
      one machine on the shop floor. The training is regularly put to good use:
      when orders must be rushed out, it happens that all hands get called on
      deck. White-collar workers come down from the office space on the first
      floor to man the machines for a few hours. It’s a wonderful
      community-building practice. People in engineering and administrative
      roles work under the guidance of the machine operators. They witness
      first-hand how hard the work on the machines can be and how much skill it
      involves. At the end of the day, when the orders are out on time,
      colleagues share a sense of pride in the work accomplisheɖ.


      [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/)’s onboarding process ends on a nice touch. New teammates who have gone through all the training modules of the first two months are asked to write an open letter to the group of colleagues they have joined. There are no instructions on what the letter should be about, so new hires often dig deep in their selfhood to find something worthwhile to say. The letters are, time and again, deeply touching accounts of gratitude and joy. Many blue-collar workers join [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) scarred from past experience of mistrust and command and control. Joining an environment where they are considered trustworthy and where their voice counts is often a groundbreaking experience. For many machine operators, writing is not their preferred style of expression. Finding the right words for the letter can take a lot of effort, and the practice is akin to a ritual, a rite of passage into the community.
  - topic: Training and Coaching
    title: At FAVI, all engineers and administrative workers have been trained to
      operate at least one machine on the shop floor. This training is put to
      good use when orders must be rushed out. All hands are called on deck.
      White-collar workers come from their office space to man the machines for
      a few hours.
    content: "It’s a wonderful community-building practice. People from engineering
      and administration work under the guidance of the machine operators. They
      see first-hand how hard this work can be, and how much skill it requires.
      When the orders are shipped on time, colleagues share a sense of pride in
      the accomplishment.\r

      \r

      FAVI also has a training program given to new members. But one
      session, only, may insufficient for someone to unlearn old habits and pick
      up new ones. The initial training modules are therefore expanded with
      follow-up training and workshops interwoven into daily life. The CEO,
      Jean- François Zobrist, used to chair a one-hour session every Friday
      morning, open to whoever wanted to join. The topic: An in-depth look at
      one of FAVI’s core organizational tools. (FAVI calls them fiches, or index
      cards, as they are literally available in the form of index cards to
      employees.) These include organization purpose, values, decision-making
      mechanisms, and lean manufacturing techniques. "
  - topic: Commitment, Working Hours and Flexibility
    title: At Favi, no one clocks in and out but workers still work in shift
      patterns and are expected to spend roughly this time on the shop floor.
    content: An operator at [Favi](http://www.favi.com/) who was having a house
      built, brought the topic up with his team. To be on site with the
      builders, he wanted to switch to the night shift. He asked if a colleague
      would be willing to swap shifts for a four month period. An arrangement
      was quickly found without the need for a formal HR approval process of
      management approval^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson
      Parker (2014), page 183].
  - topic: Job Titles and Job Descriptions
    title: A worker at FAVI might operate a number of different machines, be in
      charge of ordering supplies for his team, lead a number of continuous
      improvement actions, and be responsible for recruitment to his team.
      Except perhaps for recruitment purposes, no one bothers to write down a
      job description.
    content: "However, at [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/), one person on the team holds
      most management roles for the team ([FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) calls
      them, rather unhelpfully, a “team leader”, which might imply hierarchical
      power over their colleagues). FAVI found it works best to have one person
      free to roam among the team and only operate a machine occasionally when a
      helping hand is needed. FAVI’s team leaders act as coaches for their
      colleagues, as a clearinghouse for information, and as a point person when
      coordination is needed with other teams. This choice nevertheless carries
      a risk. Our cultural baggage of hierarchy is so strong that over time,
      team leaders could start behaving like bosses and become the primary
      decision makers on their teams. At FAVI, a simple but powerful relief
      valve exists, should a team leader find the taste of power too sweet:
      workers can choose at any moment to join another team. Team leaders have
      no meaningful way of coercing people into desired behavior; they certainly
      don’t have the authority to fire people unilaterally. If they start to
      behave autocratically, people can simply walk away"
