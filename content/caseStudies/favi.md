    title: Sending love to clients
    content: "Through a process of collective discussion, FAVI’s employees
      determined the organization had two reasons for existence, two fundamental
      purposes: the first to provide meaningful work in the area of Hallencourt,
      a rural area in northern France where good work is rare; the second to
      give and receive love from clients. Yes, love, a word rarely heard in the
      world of business, and even more unexpected in a blue-collar manufacturing
      environment. At FAVI, it has taken on real meaning. Operators don’t just
      send products to their clients, they send products into which they have
      put their heart. A few years ago, around Christmas time, an operator at
      FAVI molded excess brass into a few small figurines of Santa and of
      reindeers. He added the figurines into the boxes of finished products,
      rather like kids put a message in a bottle they throw out to sea,
      imagining that someone, somewhere, would find it. Other operators have
      since picked up on the idea and at random times of the year add brass
      figurines into their shipments, as little tokens of love to their
      counterparts working on assembly lines at Volkswagen or Volvo, who will
      find the figurines when they unpack the boxes.^\\[Laloux, Frederic

  - topic: Organizational Structure
    title: FAVI employs a customer-based parallel team structure with supporting teams
    content: "FAVI’s factory has more than 500 employees that are organized in 21
      teams called “mini-factories” of 15 to 35 people. Most of the teams are
      dedicated to a specific customer or customer type (the Volkswagen team,
      the Audi team, the Volvo team, and so forth). There are a few upstream
      production teams (the foundry team, the mold repair team, maintenance),
      and support teams (engineering, quality, lab, administration, and sales
      support). Each team self-organizes; there is no middle management, and
      there are virtually no rules or procedures other than those that the teams
      decide upon themselves. The staff functions have nearly all disappeared.
      The former HR, planning, scheduling, engineering, production-IT and
      purchasing departments have all been shut down. Their tasks have been
      taken over by the operators in the teams, who do their own hiring,
      purchasing, planning, and scheduling. The sales department has been
      disbanded too. The sales account manager for Audi is now part of the Audi
      team, just as the sales account manager for Volvo is part of the Volvo
      team. There is no head of sales above the group of account managers. In
      the old structure, white-collar workers in offices with windows
      overlooking the shop floor planned in detail what the workers needed to
      do, by when, and how. Now blue-collar workers effectively wear their own
      white collars and no longer receive instructions from above.^[Laloux,

  - topic: Coordination
    title: At FAVI, coordination happens organically on a voluntary basis through
      regular meetings, temporary project teams and reverse delegation.
    content: "At FAVI, production is organized by customer. This makes
      load-balancing a significant issue: because customer orders fluctuate, on
      any given day some teams might have too much work and others too little.
      Rather than employing a COO or staff planner to make decisions about
      allocating work across teams, FAVI chose a more organic and elegant
      solution. At regular intervals, a group composed of one designated person
      from each team comes together for a few minutes; they quickly discuss
      which teams are over or understaffed; back in their teams, they ask for
      volunteers to switch teams for a shift or two. The person from the Audi
      team, for example, might ask who in the team is willing to spend the day
      with the Volvo team. Things happen organically on a voluntary basis;
      nobody is being allocated to a team by a higher authority.^[Laloux,

  - topic: Information Flow
    title: Information flow in time of crisis.
    content: "When Jean-Francois Zobrist, the CEO of FAVI, was faced with difficult
      and critical decisions at the company, he readily admitted he needed help
      to find a good answer. More than once, on impulse, he went around the shop
      floor, asked everybody to stop the machines, climbed on a soapbox and
      shared his problem with all employees, trying to figure out a course of
      action.\r

      \r

      In time of crisis, he openly shared information with all employees
      about the reality of the situation, trusting them to handle it. As a
      result, employees did not retain a false sense of safety. Everybody,
      regardless of any rank, could take the opportunity to sense the impact of
      the information offered and resonate to it. People in the audience shouted
      questions and proposals. Together they found a collective course of action
      to overcome the crisis."
  - topic: Meetings
    title: A rhythm of meetings to suit manufacturing.
    content: >-
      Weekly senior management meetings in [Favi](http://www.favi.com/) used to
      include the heads of sales, production, maintenance, finance, HR, etc.
      These are now held at the team level.  


      Teams hold short regular meetings to align and make decisions as follows:


      * a short tactical discussion at the start of every shift

      * a weekly meeting with the sales account manager to discuss orders

      * a monthly meeting with an open agenda


      Beyond that, they tend to have no regularly scheduled meetings at all. If cross-team meetings occur, it’s in response to a specific need.
