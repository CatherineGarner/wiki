      **Large group reflective meetings:**


      Every Tuesday morning 350 employees come together to engage in joint reflection. (Some colleagues need to stay with patients.)


      Every week a new, relevant topic is put on the agenda. Topics have included: conflict resolution, dealing with failure, [values](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/culture-and-values), and similar.


      The meeting kicks off with a presentation to frame the subject matter.


      The heart of the meeting is when small groups engage in self-reflection. As for instance, the topic ‘dealing with failure’: A short presentation introduces ways to deal gracefully with failure – how new possibilities open up when we stop being judgmental about our failures, etc.


      Then people shuffle chairs around to create groups of 6 to 10 people. They reflect on the topic, guided by a facilitator they elect.  


      At some point, a microphone goes around the room and people can share what came up in the discussion.


      There is no scripted outcome to these meetings: no expected end product. As well as personal learning, collective insights emerge. Initiatives are then carried out when people go back to work.


      It’s a time-consuming practice, but people at [Heiligenfeld](http://www.heiligenfeld.de/) say the benefits far outweigh the costs. These meetings are like a company-wide training program on steroids.  


      The common experience also fosters community and a common language. To approving chuckles in the room, an employee of Heiligenfeld once stood up at the end of one such meeting and said ‘ You know, I wish I could have more Heiligenfeld at home.

    title: Heiligenfeld uses innovative management practices to create a supportive
      work culture that fosters trust, empathy, and compassion while decreasing
      conflict.
    content: At Heiligenfeld, every Tuesday morning, 350 employees come together for
      an hour and a quarter to engage in joint reflection. Every week, a new
      topic that is relevant at the moment and conducive to self-reflection is
      put on the agenda. Recent meetings have reflected on subjects as diverse
      as conflict resolution, dealing with failure, company values,
      interpersonal communication, bureaucracy, IT innovations, risk management,
      personal health, and mindfulness. The meeting always kicks off with a
      short presentation to frame the subject matter, followed by
      self-reflection in small groups. Every group elects a facilitator who
      enforces a few ground rules to create a space where it’s safe to explore,
      to be authentic and vulnerable. In the confines of the small group, helped
      by their colleagues’ listening, people dare to dig deep and gain new
      insights about themselves and others. Colleagues are exposed every week to
      a space made safe by ground rules that invites them to truly be
      themselves. They learn to see each other in the light of their deep
      humanity, in the beauty of their strengths and vulnerability. The trust,
      empathy, and compassion that build up in the meeting expand well beyond
      the confines of the meeting room. These feelings start to permeate the
      whole organization.
