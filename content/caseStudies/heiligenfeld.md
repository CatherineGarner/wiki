      **Large group reflective meetings:**


      Every Tuesday morning 350 employees come together to engage in joint reflection. (Some colleagues need to stay with patients.)


      Every week a new, relevant topic is put on the agenda. Topics have included: conflict resolution, dealing with failure, values, and similar.


      The meeting kicks off with a presentation to frame the subject matter.


      The heart of the meeting is when small groups engage in self-reflection. As for instance, the topic ‘dealing with failure’: A short presentation introduces ways to deal gracefully with failure – how new possibilities open up when we stop being judgmental about our failures, etc.


      Then people shuffle chairs around to create groups of 6 to 10 people. They reflect on the topic, guided by a facilitator they elect.  


      At some point, a microphone goes around the room and people can share what came up in the discussion.


      There is no scripted outcome to these meetings: no expected end product. As well as personal learning, collective insights emerge. Initiatives are then carried out when people go back to work.


      It’s a time-consuming practice, but people at [Heiligenfeld](http://www.heiligenfeld.de/) say the benefits far outweigh the costs. These meetings are like a company-wide training program on steroids.  


      The common experience also fosters community and a common language. To approving chuckles in the room, an employee of Heiligenfeld once stood up at the end of one such meeting and said ‘ You know, I wish I could have more Heiligenfeld at home.
