    title: RHD has developed over the years a beautiful and precisely worded Bill of
      Rights and Responsibilities for Employees and Consumers.
    content: "The first two articles spell out RHD’s objective of creating a safe
      environment and constructively managing conflict and anger. (Later
      articles deal with topics related to self- management.) The premise is
      maintained that conflict is inevitable, but that hostile behaviors are
      not:\r

      Values meeting: Every two months, all RHD colleagues are invited to
      join the values implementation meeting, where people can bring up issues
      they have encountered with values in the workplace or suggest changes to
      the Bill of Rights and Responsibilities . The meeting is well attended.
      Bob Fishman, RHD’s founder, makes a point to be present every time."
  - topic: Safe Space
    title: RHD has developed a written document called Bill of Rights and
      Responsibilities that spell out detailed ground rules for encourage safe
      behaviors and identify inacceptable behaviors (document attached)
    content: RHD has developed over the years a beautiful and precisely worded "Bill
      of Rights and Responsibilities for Employees and Consumers''. The document
      covers, among other, the topics of conflict, expressing anger, recognizing
      and managing hostility, decisions making, managing differences and open
      communications.
  - topic: Conflict resolution
    title: Clear ground rules have been written to create a safe environment and
      constructively managing conflict and anger within the context of
      self-managing teams.
    content: "Each of RHD’s programs is run by a self-managing team, with an average
      of 20 and at most 50 people. Units, as these teams are called, are
      encouraged to develop their own sense of purpose, pride, and identity.
      Units are responsible for their entire operation. Central staff at
      headquarters is kept to a minimum. Specialist staff can counsel teams, but
      the final decision is kept in the unit. At RHD, teams have a team leader
      (called “Unit Director”). Unit Directors have no power to impose decisions
      and cannot unilaterally hire or fire anybody.\r

      \r

      RHD is explicitly founded on a number of basic assumptions about
      people and work, including that: 1) all people are of equal human worth,
      2) people are essentially good unless proven otherwise, and 3) there is no
      single way to manage corporate issues well.\r

      \r

      RHD has developed a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities for
      Employees and Consumers. The first two articles spell out RHD’s objective
      of creating a safe environment and constructively managing conflict and
      anger. The organisation has identified several basic assumptions, which
      guide operations. One is that there are multiple “right” ways or paths we
      can follow in making decisions. Thus there is no one “true” or “absolute”
      reality. Each person in a situation holds his/her own view of reality and
      his/her own perspective about the most effective way to do things. Whilst
      conflict and difference (or disagreement) are to be expected, explosive or
      otherwise hostile expressions of anger are not acceptable in RHD. As a
      member of the RHD community, it is important to be able to do two things:
      a) Separate from our own need to be “right” in order to hear and respect
      others’ realities and perspectives: and, b) Differentiate between thoughts
      (what’s going on inside your head) and behaviors (what you do or say).\r

      \r

      The document goes on to spell out in detail five unacceptable
      expressions of hostility. The first, “demeaning speech and behavior”, is
      described in the following terms: Demeaning speech and behavior involves
      any verbal or nonverbal behavior that someone experiences as undermining
      of that person’s self-esteem and implies that he/she is less than worthy
      as a human being. Such behaviors include, but are not limited to,
      name-calling, ridicule, sarcasm, or other actions which “put down” people.
      Demeaning a person with such physical behaviors as rolling one’s eyes when
      the person speaks or otherwise negating her importance as a member of the
      community is also unacceptable. Anyone encountering such hostile behavior
      has the right and responsibility to surface it as an issue. Other
      expressions of hostility include ”negative triangulated messages”, “threat
      of abandonment”, “disconfirming the other person’s reality” and
      “intimidation/explosion” are defined in an equally precise manner.\r

      \r

      “Above” the teams, there are no middle managers, but rather hub
      leaders who support a number of units. Hub leaders expect to be kept
      informed of major existing or potential problems. While they may advise or
      help, the responsibility for resolving problems stays with the unit."
