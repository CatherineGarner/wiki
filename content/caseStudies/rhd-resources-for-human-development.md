    title: RHD has developed over the years a beautiful and precisely worded Bill of
      Rights and Responsibilities for Employees and Consumers.
    content: "The first two articles spell out RHD’s objective of creating a safe
      environment and constructively managing conflict and anger. (Later
      articles deal with topics related to self- management.) The premise is

      Values meeting: Every two months, all RHD colleagues are invited to
      join the values implementation meeting, where people can bring up issues
      they have encountered with values in the workplace or suggest changes to
      the Bill of Rights and Responsibilities . The meeting is well attended.
      Bob Fishman, RHD’s founder, makes a point to be present every time."
