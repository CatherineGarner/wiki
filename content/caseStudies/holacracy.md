  - topic: Organizational Structure
    title: A nested team structure
    content: Holacracy is an organizational operating system adopted by hundreds of
      organizations around the world using a nested team structure. It refers to
      teams as “circles” and to the structure as a whole as a “holarchy” (as
      distinct from a hierarchy). In a holarchy, each circle is not subjugated
      to those above it, but retains autonomy, individual authority, and
      wholeness. Circles are grouped within broader circles, all the way up
      until the biggest circle contains the entire organization. This circle is
      called the “Anchor Circle”. Teams near the "top" work on wider purposes;
      teams near the "bottom" work on more specialized purposes. Every circle
      and role within the holarchy retains real autonomy and authority as a
      cohesive, whole entity itself, while also having real responsibilities as
      a part of a larger entity. For a fuller description, see [Holacracy's
      website](http://www.holacracy.org/).
  - topic: Coordination
    title: Holacracy creates specific non-staff roles for coordination
    content: In Holacracy's structure of nested circles, there are specific
      coordinating roles called “links". Sub-circles elect a representative, the
      “Rep Link”, for its overarching circle who sits on all that circle’s
      meetings. The overarching circle sends a representative of its own, the
      “Lead Link” to be part of the discussion in the sub-circle. Both roles
      come with specific accountabilities to ensure proper coordination across
      circle and sub-circle. See also “Role Definition and Allocation”/”Concrete
      examples for inspiration”/”Holacracy” and [Holacracy's
      constitution](http://www.holacracy.org/constitution).
