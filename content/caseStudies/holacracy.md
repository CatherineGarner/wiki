    title: A nested team structure
    content: Holacracy is an organizational operating system adopted by hundreds of
      organizations around the world using a nested team structure. It refers to
      teams as “circles” and to the structure as a whole as a “holarchy” (as
      distinct from a hierarchy). In a holarchy, each circle is not subjugated
      to those above it, but retains autonomy, individual authority, and
      wholeness. Circles are grouped within broader circles, all the way up
      until the biggest circle contains the entire organization. This circle is
      called the “Anchor Circle”. Teams near the "top" work on wider purposes;
      teams near the "bottom" work on more specialized purposes. Every circle
      and role within the holarchy retains real autonomy and authority as a
      cohesive, whole entity itself, while also having real responsibilities as
      a part of a larger entity. For a fuller description, see [Holacracy's
      website](http://www.holacracy.org/).
