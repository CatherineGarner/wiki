  Organizational operating model 


  [Holacracy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy)is a method of decentralized management and organizational governance, in which authority and decision-making are distributed throughout a holarchy of self-organizing teams rather than being vested in a management hierarchy


  The Holacracy system was developed at Ternary Software, a company in Pennsylvania company.

  - topic: Organizational Structure
    title: A nested team structure
    content: Holacracy is an organizational operating system adopted by hundreds of
      organizations around the world using a nested team structure. It refers to
      teams as “circles” and to the structure as a whole as a “holarchy” (as
      distinct from a hierarchy). In a holarchy, each circle is not subjugated
      to those above it, but retains autonomy, individual authority, and
      wholeness. Circles are grouped within broader circles, all the way up
      until the biggest circle contains the entire organization. This circle is
      called the “Anchor Circle”. Teams near the "top" work on wider purposes;
      teams near the "bottom" work on more specialized purposes. Every circle
      and role within the holarchy retains real autonomy and authority as a
      cohesive, whole entity itself, while also having real responsibilities as
      a part of a larger entity. For a fuller description, see [Holacracy's
      website](http://www.holacracy.org/).
  - topic: Coordination
    title: Holacracy creates specific non-staff roles for coordination
    content: In Holacracy's structure of nested circles, there are specific
      coordinating roles called “links". Sub-circles elect a representative, the
      “Rep Link”, for its overarching circle who sits on all that circle’s
      meetings. The overarching circle sends a representative of its own, the
      “Lead Link” to be part of the discussion in the sub-circle. Both roles
      come with specific accountabilities to ensure proper coordination across
      circle and sub-circle. See also “Role Definition and Allocation”/”Concrete
      examples for inspiration”/”Holacracy” and [Holacracy's
      constitution](http://www.holacracy.org/constitution).
  - topic: Role Definition and Allocation
    title: A well defined process to create, modify and assign roles
    content: >-
      In Holacratic language, people don’t have a job, but fill a number of
      *roles*. (The Holacracy constitution defines a role as consisting of three
      specific elements: a “purpose” to express; possibly one or more “domains”
      to control; and a set of “accountabilities” to enact. Some roles will have
      all three of these parts, though often roles will start out with only a
      purpose or just a single accountability and evolve from there. A purpose
      tells us why the role exists: what it aims to achieve. A domain (of which
      there may be several) specifies something the role has the exclusive
      authority to control on behalf of the organization— in other words, this
      role’s “property,” which no other role can mess with. And each
      accountability is an ongoing activity that the role has the authority to
      perform and is expected to perform or otherwise manage for the
      organization.^\[Robertson, Brian J.. Holacracy: The New Management System
      for a Rapidly Changing World (Kindle Locations 619-623). Henry Holt and
      Co.. Kindle Edition.]


      When someone senses that a new role must be created or an existing role amended or discarded, they bring it up within their team in a governance meeting.  Governance meetings are specific meetings where only questions related to roles and collaboration are to be discussed. A detailed description of the governance meeting process can be found [here](http://www.holacracy.org/governance-meetings).


      Holacracy's constitution calls for organizing roles into “circles”. The roles a circle contains are a breakdown of what’s needed to express its overall purpose, enact its accountabilities, and control its domains. Circles (“sub-circles”) are in turn grouped within broader circles (“super-circles”) in a nesting fashion all the way up until the biggest circle contains the entire organization (the “anchor circle”).^\[Robertson, Brian J.. Holacracy: The New Management System for a Rapidly Changing World (Kindle Locations 676-677). Henry Holt and Co. Kindle Edition.]


      In Holacracy, each sub-circle contains a special governance role called the “Lead Link” which is appointed by the super-circle to represent its interests in the sub-circle. The Lead Link does not manage the circle but does have the authority to assign people to roles and to set priorities within that circle.


      Holacracy's constitution stipulates that certain specific roles (the facilitator, the secretary, the Lead Link and the "Rep Link") are appointed using a consent-based election. All other roles are appointed by the person holding the team's Lead Link role. (See [Holacracy's constitution ](http://www.holacracy.org/constitution)for a detailed description of the process).
