    title: HolacracyOne has created an effective set of meetings serving a specific
      purpose.
    content: "In Holacracy there are 4 meeting types:\r

      \r

      All meetings start with a 'check-in\" and close with a
      'check-out'.\r

      \r

      Tactical meetings:  These short daily or weekly meetings serve the
      operational process. Here work is coordinated. Operational processes are
      addressed, actions decided, and things get done. \r

      \r

      Strategic meetings:  These rare meetings have no specific form and
      process thinking about how to best serve the evolutionary purpose.\r

      \r

      Special topic meetings:   Held when a topic calls for special
      attention. These meetings also have no specific form.\r

      \r

      Governance meetings:  These meetings are restricted to roles, and
      collaboration; not the rough and tumble of getting work done. The latter
      are for tactical meetings.  Governance meetings are held generally every
      month. They follow strict process to ensure everyboneâ€™s voice is heard and
      that no one can dominate decision-making. A facilitator guides the
      proceeding via the following process:\r

      \r

      1. Present proposal\r

      \r

      1. Clarifying questions\r

      \r

      1. Reaction round\r

      \r

      1. Amend and clarify\r

      \r

      1. Objection round\r

      \r

      1. Integration\r

      \r

      The process might sound formal and needs to get used to, but people
      who use it report they find it deeply liberating and dramatically
      efficient."
