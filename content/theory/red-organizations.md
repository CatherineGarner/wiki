  红色组织是红色意识阶段出现的，它通过一个粗糙的权力镜头来看待世界。“酋长”不断行使权力，让步兵保持整齐。恐惧和不可预测性让组织团结在一起。红色组织倾向于高度反应，关注短期利益。这使得他们非常适合在混乱的环境中茁壮成长。狼群是红色组织的一个很好的比喻。

  ### Red stage of consciousness


  历史上，红色意识似乎出现在大约10000年前，产生了第一个酋长国和原始帝国。最早的组织形式也是在这个时候出现的。


  这个阶段的人们具有强烈的自我意识，认为自己与他人和世界完全分离。这种身份分离认识带来恐惧，认为死亡是真实的。如果我只是与整体分离的一个小部分，✳我就可能会遭受痛苦或死亡。✳世界被视为一个危险的地方，一个人的需要能否得到满足、取决于是否坚强和强硬。世界的货币是权力。✳如果我比你强大，我可以保证自己的需求得到满足；如果你比我强大，我会屈服，希望你能照顾我。✳情绪波段相当粗糙，人们经常通过发脾气和暴力来表达需求。即使领导者知道别人的感受，也不会去重视。定位主要是在导向——我想要它，我现在就想要它——但这种冲动可以通过简单的权力、操纵或服从策略延伸到未来。理解了简单的因果关系，如对奖励和惩罚的理解。思维是两极对立的，形成了二元黑白世界观——例如，强/弱，我的方式/你的方式。


  角色分化变得可行——或者换句话说，出现了有意义的分工。首领和步兵分工不同。奴隶制大规模出现，任务和劳作开始被区分出来，分配给被打败并被奴役的邻近部落的敌人来完成。从历史上看，这让一个酋长有能力统治数百人甚至数千人。在当今世界的许多部落社会，甚至再发达社会中的贫困地区，仍然可以发现成年人按照红色模式运作。每一种范式都有它的最佳点，一个最合适的语境。红色非常适合于敌对环境：战斗区、内战、失败的州、监狱或充满暴力的市中心社区。


  ### Characteristics of Red organizations


  Organizations molded in Red consciousness first appeared in the form of small conquering armies, when the more powerful chiefdoms grew into proto-empires. They can still be found today in the form of street gangs and mafias. Today’s Red Organizations borrow tools and ideas from modernity―think about organized crime’s use of weaponry and information technology. But their structures and practices are for the most part still molded in the Red paradigm.


  Their ‘glue’ is the continuous exercise of power in interpersonal relationships. Wolf packs provide a good metaphor: rather like the “alpha wolf” uses power when needed to maintain his status within the pack, the chief of a Red Organization must demonstrate overwhelming power and bend others to his will to stay in position. The minute his power is in doubt, someone else will attempt to topple him. To provide some stability, the chief surrounds himself with family members (who tend to be more loyal) and buys their allegiance by sharing the spoils. Each member of his close guard in turn looks after his own people and keeps them in line. Overall, there is no formal hierarchy and there are no job titles. Red Organizations don’t scale well for those reasons―they rarely manage to keep in line people who are separated from the chief by more than three or four degrees. While Red Organizations can be extremely powerful (especially in hostile environments where later stages of organizations tend to break down), they are inherently fragile, due to the impulsive nature of people’s way of operating (*I want it so I take it*). The chief must regularly resort to public displays of cruelty and punishment, as only fear and submission keep the organization from disintegrating. Mythical stories about his absolute power frequently make the rounds, to keep foot soldiers from vying for a higher prize.


  Present-centeredness makes Red Organizations poor at planning and strategizing but highly reactive to new threats and opportunities that they can pursue ruthlessly. They are therefore well adapted to chaotic environments (in civil wars or in failed states) but are ill-suited to achieve complex outcomes in stable environments where planning and strategizing are possible.
