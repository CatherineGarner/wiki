  意识的琥珀阶段^\[这一阶段对应于格布瑟所说的“神话”，洛文杰、库克格雷特和韦德的“墨守成规”，格雷夫斯的“DQ”，螺旋动力学派的“蓝色”，克根的“人际关系”，托伯特的“外交官”和“专家”，皮亚杰的“实用操作”以及其他一些人的学说。]
  将人类组织发展到一种能以前所未有的规模运作的形态。琥珀催化了官僚机构、联邦国家和民族国家的形成，其中许多组织已经存在了好几个世纪。琥珀组织力求稳定，其特点是在等级结构中定义有明确的角色和等级。通过指挥和控制来实现领导权，整个组织都需要服从。通过规则和程序来实现稳定和秩序。不鼓励创新，不欢迎竞争。最主要的比喻是军队。但也许最重要的琥珀组织是天主教会。

  #### 琥珀意识阶段


  每一次意识模式转换都会带来前所未有的新能力和可能性。当琥珀意识出现时，人类从一个以园艺为生的部落世界跃升到农业、国家和文明、机构、官僚机制和有组织宗教的时代。根据发展心理学家的说法，当今发达社会的成年人口中有很大一部分依然基于这一范式运作。琥珀色阶段通过牛顿的眼睛感知世界。知晓因果关系。


  在琥珀阶段，人们可以掌握线性时间（过去、现在、未来）并预测未来。这就是农业可能出现的土壤：农业需要自律和远见，从今年的收成中保留种子，以供应明年的粮食。农业所产生的热量过剩可以养活一些新的阶级：统治者、管理者、牧师、战士和工匠；这大约从公元前4000年开始在美索不达米亚，催化了从酋长制到国家和文明的转变。


  最主要的比喻是军队。


  ##### 角色认同


  琥珀意识培养了用来感受和感知他人的更深层次意识。儿童心理学家的先驱皮亚杰给出过一个关于琥珀认知的实验。把一个双色的球放在儿童和成人之间，绿色的一面对着儿童，红色的一面对着成人。在琥珀色阶段之前，孩子还不能从别人的角度看世界，他会声称他和大人都看到了一个绿色的球。在六、七岁左右的时候，一个在滋养意识成长环境中长大的孩子，将学会通过别人的眼睛看世界，并能正确识别成年人看到了球的红色一面。从心理上讲，这个意识飞跃的影响很巨大。我可以认同我的观点和我的角色，并知道这与你的不同。我也能想象别人对我的看法。此时，我的自我和自我价值感在很大程度上是建立在别人观点上的。我会争取得到认可和接受，并在我的社交圈中占据一席之地。在这个阶段，人们已经会内化群体规范，思维的基础取决于一个人是否符合群体规范的外表、行为和相应的思想。红色阶段的二元思维依然健在，但基于个人主义的“按照我的方式，还是你的方式”被基于集体主义的“按照我们的方式，还是他们的方式”所取代。红色的自我中心主义已经让位给琥珀色的种族中心主义。肯·威尔伯这样说：关心和关注从我扩展到了整个团队——但并没有进步太多！如果你是这个团体的一员——是我的神话，我的意识形态的一员——那么你就能“得救”。但是如果你属于不同的文化，不同的群体，不同的神话，不同的上帝，那么你就该死。^\[Ken Wilber, A Brief History of Everything (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 1996), 273.]


  ##### Self discipline and authority


  In Amber, the formerly impulsive Red self is now able to exercise self-discipline and self-control, not only in public but also in private. Amber societies have simple morals based on one accepted, right way of doing things. The Amber worldview is static: there are immutable laws that make for a just world, where things are either right or wrong. Do what’s right and you will be rewarded, in this life or the next. Do or say the wrong things, and you will be punished or even rejected from the group―and possibly suffer in the hereafter. People internalize the rules and morality and feel guilt and shame when they go astray. Authority to define what is right and wrong is now linked to a role, rather than to a powerful personality (as was the case in Red); it’s the priest’s robe, whoever wears it, that defines authority.


  Amber societies tend to be highly stratified, with social classes or caste systems and rigid gender differences as defining features. A lottery at birth defines what caste you are born into. From there, everything is mapped out for you―how you are to behave, think, dress, eat, and marry is in accordance with your caste.


  With so much in flux in the world today, some find Amber certainties an appealing refuge and call for a return to a fixed set of moral values. To take that perspective is to ignore the massive inequality of traditional societies that set strict social and sexual norms. It can be unpleasant, to say the least, to be a woman, a homosexual, an untouchable, or a free thinker in an Amber society.


  #### Breakthroughs and characteristics of Amber organizations


  The advent of Amber organizations brought about two major breakthroughs: organizations can now plan for the medium and long term, and they can create organizational structures that are stable and can scale. Combine these two breakthroughs, and you get organizations able to achieve unprecedented outcomes, beyond anything Red organizations could have even contemplated. Historically, Amber organizations are the ones that have built irrigation systems, pyramids, and the Great Wall of China. Amber organizations ran the ships, the trading posts, and the plantations of the Colonial world. The Catholic Church is built on this paradigm―arguably it has been the defining Amber organization for the Western world. The first large corporations of the Industrial Revolution were run on this template. Amber organizations are still very present today: most government agencies, public schools, religious institutions, and the military are run based on Amber principles and practices.


  ##### Amber breakthrough 1: Long-term perspective (stable processes)


  Red organizations tend to be opportunistic; they don’t generally think more than a few weeks ahead. Amber organizations can take on long-term projects―constructing cathedrals that might take two centuries to complete or creating networks of colonial trading posts thousands of miles away to facilitate commerce.


  This breakthrough is very much linked to the invention of processes. With processes, we can replicate past experience into the future. Last year’s harvest will be our template for this year’s; next year’s classroom will be run with the same lesson plan as this year’s. With processes, critical knowledge no longer depends on a particular person; it is embedded in the organization and can be transmitted across generations. Any person can be replaced by another that takes over the same role in the process. Even the chief is replaceable, in an orderly succession, and Amber organizations can therefore survive for centuries.


  At an individual level, people operating from a Amber paradigm strive for order and predictability; change is viewed with suspicion. The same holds true for Amber organizations, which are exceptionally well-suited for a stable world where the future can be planned based on past experience. They operate on the hidden assumption that there is one right way of doing things and that the world is (or should be) absolute. What has worked in the past will work in the future. Amber organizations find it hard to accept the need for change. The idea that there is one right way makes them uncomfortable with competition. Historically, they have striven for dominance and monopoly.


  ##### Amber breakthrough 2: Size and stability (formal hierarchies)


  In Red organizations, power structures are in constant flux as personalities jockey for influence. Amber organizations bring stability to power, with formal titles, fixed hierarchies, and organization charts. The overall structure settles into a well defined hierarchy. The plant manager is in charge of the department heads, who in turn oversee unit managers, line managers, foremen, and operators. Personal allegiance to the chief is no longer needed because everyone knows where they fit in the hierarchy. Much larger organizations become possible, spanning not hundreds but thousands of workers, and they can operate across vast distances. Mankind’s first global organizations―from the Catholic Church to the East India Company―were built on a Amber template.


  Planning and execution are strictly separated: the thinking happens at the top, the doing at the bottom. Decisions made at the top get handed down through successive layers of management. Control is maintained through compliance with rules and procedures. Leaders at all levels are given responsibility for compliance and can discipline those found wanting..


  The underlying worldview is that workers are mostly lazy, dishonest, and in need of direction. They must be supervised and told what is expected of them. Participatory management seems foolish from an Amber perspective; management must rely on command and control to achieve results. Jobs at the frontlines are specific and often routine. Innovation, critical thinking, and self-expression are not asked for (and are often discouraged). Information is shared on an as-needed basis. People are effectively interchangeable resources.


  From the vantage point of later stages, this might sound severely limiting. But as a step up from Red, it is major progress. Even people at the bottom of the organization feel that the predictability of routine work is liberating compared to the constant vigilance required in Red organization.. We no longer need to watch out for threats and danger that might come unexpectedly from any direction. We just need to follow the rules.


  ##### Amber shadow: the social mask


  Size and stability become possible because people in Amber are content to stay in their place in return for safety and predictability. People operating from this stage closely identify with their role and position. Amber organizations have invented and generalized the use of titles, ranks, and uniforms to bolster role identification. A bishop’s robe signals that inside is no mere priest. A general’s uniform can hardly be confused with a lieutenant’s or a private’s, even from far away. In factories, the owner, the engineer, the accountant, the foreman, and the machine operator tend to dress differently, even to this day. When we put on our ‘uniform’, we also put on a distinct identity, a social mask. We internalize behaviors that are expected of people with our rank and in our line of work. As a worker, it’s not only that I wear a different clothes to the engineer. I eat in the workers’ mess; he eats in the factory restaurant. And in these places, the subjects of conversation, the jokes, and the type of self-disclosure are vastly different. Social stability comes at the price of wearing a mask, of learning to distance ourselves from our unique nature, from our personal desires, needs, and feelings; instead, we embrace a socially acceptable self.


  Historically, this hierarchical stratification in organizations paralleled social stratification: The roles you could aspire to depended on your families position in society. It was often very difficult to ‘break the mold’. Fortunately, that rigid social stratification has disappeared in modern societies. Today’s Amber organizations still tend to reinforce hierarchy, albeit in more subtle ways. Promotion is often based on experience and service and sometimes the most qualified do not get the job because they haven’t ticked all the right boxes.


  ##### Amber shadow: Us versus them


  Social belonging is paramount in the Amber paradigm. You are part of the group, or you are not―it is “us” versus “them.” This dividing line can be found throughout Amber organizations―nurses versus doctors versus administrators, line versus staff, frontline versus headquarters etc. Amber organizations have definitive silos, and groups eye each other with suspicion across them. Co-operation and trust is enabled through procedures and rules that people have to abide by.


  If there are barriers inside the organization, there is a moat between the organization and the outside world. Amber organizations try wherever possible to be self-contained and autonomous. Early car factories had their own rubber plantations and steel mills, operated their own bakeries, and provided social housing. Employees also “belong” to the organization: employment is assumed to be lifelong, and much of people’s social life revolves around the organization. The possibility of dismissal therefore carries a double threat: employees risk losing both the identity the work gives them as well as the social fabric they are embedded in. Someone who decides to leave the organization is often met with bewilderment, if not accused of betrayal. Many of today’s Amber organizations still have lifetime employment as an underlying norm. For those who decide to leave, the process is often painful―akin to shedding an old life and having to reinvent a new one.
