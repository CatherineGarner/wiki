  ## 新视角


  [蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) 的目标是建立一个安全的空间，让同事们能自由放心的展现出自己人性的本来面目，展示作为男性和女性的自我，展示理性、情感、直觉和精神各个层面的自我，展示自己的优势和弱点，以及更深层的希望和渴求。


  ### 红色组织


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，可以在老板的命令中找到一些安全感。只要表现出忠诚，听从老板的意愿和命令，你就知道自己去论如何都是安全的。反之，等待着违抗老板者的只能是严厉的惩罚。


  ### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，安全来自于遵循既定的规则和流程（这些规则和流程比红色模式中老板那不断变化的突发奇想要稳定得多）。在琥珀组织中，就业以终身制为主，成员的大部分社会生活都围绕着这个组织。惩罚不再意味着肉体上的暴力，而是可以扣除工资、降低职级和特权以及解雇。因此，解雇伴随着双重威胁：失去身份并被逐出所属的社会结构。离开一个琥珀色的组织通常是一个痛苦和可怕的过程，类似于放弃一个熟悉而安全的旧人生，而重新开始新的人生。（简言之：回避暴力的安全感）


  ### 橙色组织


  在[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，安全来自于对预期结果的达成。一个人的身份不再局限于某个特定的组织，而是更广泛地与个人的职业发展联系在一起。失败和被解雇对一个人的自我价值是一个打击，但不再意味着从某个社会结构中被驱逐。只需继续前进，到另一个组织寻求工作即可。（简言之：回避社交排斥的安全感）。


  ### 绿色组织


  在[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，安全来自于一系列共同的价值观，以及每个人都被视为有生命的人，而不仅仅是“人力资源”。当个人或组织遇到困难时，员工相信同事会团结起来提供支持。（简而言之：情感安全）。


  ### Teal organizations


  [蔚蓝组织 ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)的目标是打造一个能让自大人格放下戒备的安全空间，允许人们将完整人性代入职场。（简而言之：灵魂的安全）

  ## 实践中


  ### 安全空间的重要性


  在大多数传统组织以及工作之余的大多数群体环境中，个人一般会感觉到风险而不能尽情展示完整人性和真实自我。几乎每个人都在童年时期就知道，当我们暴露自己的真实面目，即自己最珍贵的部分时，我们就会感到脆弱：我们怕敞开心扉，可能受到嘲笑或看不惯，或者被敌意者用我们分享的内容来攻击我们。于是，更好的办法是稳妥行事，躲在职业的面具后面，只表演一个在职场可以被接受和期待的人格。


  如此伪装人格获得安全是有代价的：我们把自己从丰富完整的人性中剥离出来。我们觉得在职场需要戴的面具往往是心理健康的、理性的、阳刚的、以自我为中心的。我们切断了自己的情感、直觉、身体、阴性侧面。我们不理会自己内心的声音，我们的渴望，我们的召唤，我们的灵魂。我们忽视了自己的沟通能力和同情心，和对自己、对他人以及对周围所有生命的爱。这样做可能会让我们感到安全。但代价是人生中常常感到空虚和毫无生机。


  [蔚蓝组织 ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)已经意识到，当员工们来职场时，如果将如此大量的真实人性关在门外，随之而去的还有大量的激情、创造力和生命力与精力。所以蔚蓝真正致力于创造一个安全的环境，一个安心空间，让员工觉得自己可以安全地展示[完整人性](../wholeness/)。


  ### 确立基本规则


  创建安全的职场，首先要提高每个人的觉性，致力于共同创造或支撑安全工作环境的心态、言行。一些组织发现，编写一份用于详细说明组织内人员如何互动的基本规则文档，非常重要。这样的文件，定义了要鼓励的言行，和认为不可接受的言行，以及各种潜在的假设和心态。可以说，这些详细的基本规则，是将许多组织所定义的共同价值观提升到了下一个层次：如果这些是我们的价值观，那我们希望鼓励什么样的行为，哪些行为是不可接受的？（执行标尺）


  历史上许多灵性和传统智慧都阐述了丰富的技巧，可以用来创造安全空间，克服恐惧和分离，并邀请个体进入不评判姿态，回归整体性（完整人性）。许多当代思想家也调整或重新发明了类似的原则和实践，可用于在组织范围内创造安全空间，例如支撑组织和谐建设的空间。蔚蓝组织通常会花大量时间培训每个成员，令其熟知并运用这些基本规则，例如作为新同事[入职](../onboarding/)培训的一部分，让基本原则尽可能得到每个人的支持，而不需要通过推进者来督促执行。


  Typical ground rules include


  * *Speaking from "I":* rather than making interpretations and judging another person's actions or motivation, we try and put into words our own reactions, emotions, needs and requests.  

  * *No fixing, advising, saving or correcting others:* when others feel we have an intention to change them, they are likely to feel intruded upon and to feel the space is no longer safe for them to show up as they are.  

  * *Accepting emotions*: many cultures especially in most organizations today are generally ill at ease with "negative" emotions such as anger, sadness or frustration (and sometimes even of "positive" emotions such as joy or empathy). When someone shares such an emotion, we are often quick to try and get the person to "get over" their emotion, thereby giving the message that someone's emotion is not welcome. 

  * *Accepting conflict*: these cultures are also generally ill at ease with conflicts, that get quickly passed over. And yet, conflict is a natural consequence of the fact that as human beings, we all have different needs and perspectives. Having a well defined [conflict resolution process](../conflict-resolution/) in place is helpful, as well as clear guidelines to help deal with conflict gracefully. 

  * *Avoiding demeaning speech and behaviors*: To feel safe, we need to feel that we are accepted as equals in value. Any form of -ism (sexism, racism, etc.) as well as any form, however subtle, that establishes that one person is superior to another (snide remark, rolling of the eyes, and so forth) will make us feel unsafe and trigger our ego defenses. 

  * *Questioning one's perspective:* A safe space is one where we can explore our feelings and thoughts without fear of judgment. That exploration is made difficult, if someone else believes they are right, and that by contrast, everyone with a different question must be wrong. We must enter every discussion with a willingness to see things from different perspectives, to question our own perspective and assumption..  


  ### Recurring moments to reaffirm ground rules


  Unfortunately, we don't learn about how to create a safe space in school. Commonly writing a document with the ground rules for a safe space might be a helpful way for colleagues in the organization to steep themselves in this thinking. They can be used as a powerful training program during new colleagues' [onboarding process](../onboarding/). Many organizations find that this is not enough, though, for everyone to deeply integrate these ground rules in their mindsets and behaviors. It is useful to foresee recurring moments where the ground rules are reaffirmed, role modeled and explicitly enforced by a colleague taking on a facilitator's role. These recurring moments can include:


  * Important, recurring meetings (for instance quarterly all-hands meetings) 

  * Large group processes to [listen to an organizations' purpose](../listening-to-purpose/) (for instance using methodologies such as Theory U, Appreciative Inquiry, or Open Space) 

  * Any meetings that promises to be difficult or touchy, where the presence of a facilitator might be helpful 

  * An annual "values day" 

  * Any training program or workshop.
faq:
  - question: How can ground rules for a safe space be established? What is the role
      of the founder or "CEO" in the process?
    answer: "As a founder or leader of the organization, you might be the main (or
      perhaps even only) person to sense that creating safe space is critical.
      Can you \"impose\" the creating of safe space? How could you involve
      others in writing down a set of ground rules, if you are the only one that
      sees the need? \r

      \r

      The best way to establish a set of ground rules is to involve as
      many people as possible in the organization. How can that be done? Being
      in a space where we feel truly safe is a liberating feeling, but that
      unfortunately, many people (and therefore many of your colleagues) might
      never have experienced in the workplace. And yet, it is something we all
      long for, and that in some small way we have all experienced at some
      point. Large group processes, such as Appreciative Inquiry, for instance,
      can be great catalysts to bring people to reflect on and acknowledge the
      importance of feeling safe, and to collectively develop a set of ground
      rules. \r

      \r

      Using the Appreciative Inquiry framework as an example (but other
      large group processes could be used too), you could invite the entire
      organization (small or large, or subsections of the organization):\r

      \r

      * to inquire, in a deep reflection in paired interviews, into
      moments (for instance in a conversation with a friend of family member)
      where they have felt safe enough to show up whole. What did it feel like?
      What were the necessary conditions?\r

      * participants then share some of the stories and insights into a
      broader circle (which itself is one that role models safe space), and
      commonly establish some of the necessary conditions that were present.\r

      * from those necessary conditions, participants to self-organize
      into groups that craft a document which establishes the ground rules\r

      * as a last step, participants to jointly define the recurring
      moments during the year where the ground rules will be affirmed and
      role-modeled by a facilitator. \r


      The role you can play as founder or CEO is to be the initiator and
      convener, possibly the one choosing an external facilitator that might
      hold the space for the process of Appreciative Inquiry or the methodology
      you'll have chosen. In the invitation to the group, you can speak
      powerfully to why you believe this is important. Once in the group
      process, you can relax and become one voice among the many contributing to
      establish the ground rules. "
