  本文讨论传统的“变化管理”与蔚蓝模式下变化管理过程的区别。

  ![](/media/change.jpg)
perspective: >-
  在橙色的机械式范式中，组织被视为固定不变的系统。这些系统没有内在的改变能力。所以必须从外部施力。这就是高级管理层的作用。他们负责确定变革的必要性，确定变革将如何实现，并确保变革发生。


  蔚蓝前组织是建立在这些旧模式的基础上，所以推动变革确实很不易。这些早期范式将变革视为不幸的结果，或管理失败的结果。传统管理层的工作是为了预测和/或控制未来，这当然会带来令他们吃惊的结果。他们认为现实应该符合一个执行良好的预算和战略计划。如果结果不如意，管理层往往迟迟不承认他们的失败。当他们最终承认说，在追求自己的计划时，周围的世界已经发生了变化时，往往会对自己所见到的现实感到不安。于是感觉到必须再次采取果断行动，才能弥补损失的时间。进而导致进一步的紧急施压。


  他们认为改变是痛苦的，但一旦完成，一切都会好起来。因此，会赶紧重新设计组织的机构。人们会抵制强加给自己的变革，这毫不奇怪。为了克服这一点，管理层可能会迫不及待的利用成员的恐惧，来迫使大家做出迅速反应，或将责任推卸给敌对的竞争力量或威胁组织生存的巨大环境压力。


  因此，早期模式的变革，往往发生在一系列的强制“跳跃”中。而不是如大自然般的流动性过程。变化成了从一个相对静止状态到另一个相对静止状态的一系列离散的、通常是破坏性的运动。

  相比之下，生物系统似乎有能力感知环境的变化并从内部自发适应。在森林里，没有一棵头树计划并命令其他树木在没下雨，或春天选择提早到来时该做些什么。此时此刻，整个生态系统都会自发做出创造性的反应。蔚蓝组织以类似的方式处理变革。人们被鼓励去做他们认为需要的事情。他们不受静态的职位描述、固定的上下指令汇报关系或职能纪律的限制。他们会对组织生命过程中出现的非线性变化做出创造性的反应。蔚蓝模式内的变化是意料之中的，总是自然而然地发生。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  有关早期阶段如何经历组织变革的更多信息如下：


  #### 红色组织


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，变革由老板指挥。红色组织通常能在混乱的环境中迅速适应，因为领导者可以在必要时通过恐吓来发起迅速的变革。变革通常包括对威胁和机遇的直接反应，而不是对更为渐进和长期（尽管同样重要）发展作出的反应。很少有人注意到或注重于随着时间的推移，来逐渐改变根深蒂固的成员行为模式。


  #### 琥珀组织


  [琥珀模式](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)认为，世界在本质上是（或应该）不变的：昨天真实的事物和道理，在今天和明天也应该是真实的。组织是围绕着一个有序结构以及一个正式而稳定的过程而构建的。变革主要是通过小的改进提高现有流程和习惯的卓越性。琥珀组织可以表现出对变革需求的强烈抵制，尤其是当变革的性质威胁到意识形态界限或社会规范时。当外部力量确实要求变革时，变革会自上而下发生，几乎不考虑如何适当的计划变革以尽量减少阻力。从这个意义上讲，几乎没有什么“变革管理”可言。


  #### 橙色组织


  [橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/) are more likely to embrace change. Innovation is the key to outperforming competitors. Change should be constant. Unfortunately, as Orange organizations are typically structured as hierarchical pyramids, change can be difficult. Thus, the constant pursuit of change, hindered by the static nature of the organization, gave rise to "change management" and an industry of tools and consultancies to help organizations overcome their internal resistance to change.^\[For prominent theories developed to facilitate organizational change, see for instance Kurt Lewin’s three-stage model of change and John Kotter’s eight-step process for leading change.]


  In Orange, the dominant perspective on change comes from engineering. The typical steps to any change (e.g., re-organizations, re-structuring, re-branding, re-positioning, etc.) are to diagnose the current situation, design the desired future state, and then plan the change journey from here to there. For large change projects, this might involve several projects, program milestones and a central "program office" that reports to the top leadership. This kind of change planning is typically performed by a small team of senior leaders or "high potentials", sometimes with the help of external consultants. When their plan is approved by senior management, it is communicated throughout the organization, often with some “burning platform” message (“we must act now, or we are doomed”) due to the perceived need to provide the necessary motivation for change. Consistent with the Orange metaphor likening the organization to a machine, the phrase “drive change” is common. Change, in others words, is done to people, not via people.


  #### Green organizations


  [Green organizations](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/) try to be more consensual. Having only a handful of people design the future state and change process sits uncomfortably with Green's ideal of empowerment. More people are likely to be involved. This might take the form of large group workshops and innovative facilitation techniques (think for instance, Appreciative Inquiry, Theory U, Open Space, etc.) in which a large number of colleagues participate. The every-day hierarchical structure of the organization is suspended temporarily to make room for an organic process of collective intelligence. The outcomes are then fed back into the traditional structures and processes of the organization. Involving a larger number of colleagues in the planning of change can feel risky for the senior leadership (what if the group veers in a direction we don't want?), but it tends to increase the buy-in of employees and improve future designs by capturing the insights of collective intelligence.

  Change management is less of an issue in Teal organizations. Change tends to
  happen more naturally, and continuously, with less effort or management. It's
  an evolutionary process which can be initiated by anyone and managed by
  everyone. As the organization evolves, it changes on a daily basis, and there
  is rarely a need for major overhaul or drastic change management programs.
  Change management as a field of practice mostly disappears.


  #### Change on a continuous basis


  Thinking of Teal organizations as living systems helps to explain how change unfolds within them. Living systems have a capacity to sense change in the environment and adapt. They react creatively, in the moment. Teal organizations deal with change in a similar way. People are free to act on what they sense is needed. They are not restricted by static job descriptions, reporting lines and functional units. They can react to emerging events. Specific methods embedded in the organization allow space for people to listen to the organization's purpose and the change it may require. When everyone is free to sense the need for change, and to act on it, change is a given; it happens naturally, everywhere, all the time, mostly without great pain or effort. Major disruptive change efforts (as we know them from more traditional organizations) largely disappear.


  #### When large scale change is needed


  Even in those rare situations when large scale change is needed, Teal organizations naturally work to involve all those affected by the change in determining the appropriate response. In most cases, Teal organizations will uphold the advice process, even if it means including the entire organization. Experience has shown that, in most cases, colleagues have the maturity to participate in even painful decisions and the ingenuity to come up with creative solutions.


  When many colleagues are involved, large group processes, such as Theory U, Appreciative Inquiry, Open Space or others may be used to effectively surface a collective understanding and to crystallize a vision of the future. To what degree do change projects then need to be formally planned and followed up? As is often true within the Teal paradigm, form follows function. For instance, if there are many interdependencies, very tight deadlines, or high degrees of risk, more formal planning and follow-up might be needed. In other cases, a common, clear understanding of the future is all that is required. Groups of people launch the necessary projects to manifest the collective vision. If that fails to happen, the system will self-correct: someone will speak up to initiate further change.
faq:
  - question: "Surely a Teal organization must sometimes face a situation where
      drastic change and top-down decision-making are needed: Are traditional
      change management methods helpful in such cases?"
    answer: Teal organizations tend to adapt continuously to small changes in the
      environment. But sometimes the organization can fail to adapt to a number
      of changes that build up over time. In other cases, a sudden, external
      shock occurs (say, the biggest client goes bust, or a key regulation
      changes). In such circumstances, drastic and quick actions may be
      necessary, calling for the [advice process](../decision-making/) to be
      suspended, and for decisions to be made quickly by a small group of people
      or even an individual. However, it is made clear to all that such a
      suspension is temporary. See “Crisis Management”.
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      All three Teal breakthroughs support a more fluid, organic approach to
      change that makes "change management" largely irrelevant.


      ##### *Self-management*


      Self-management encourages everyone to sense when change is needed and to initiate the necessary actions to make it happen. No longer do people wait for a mandate for change to come from someone higher up the chain of command.


      ##### *Wholeness*


      The more colleagues can show up from a place of wholeness at work, the better they can sense changes in the environment and what the organization's purpose might call for. An environment that feels safe and trusting will also make it easier to enlist colleagues in the need for change, especially when the proposed change might be risky or painful.


      ##### *Evolutionary purpose*


      Earlier organizational paradigms (predict and control) hold that that it is up to senior management to determine what the objectives of the organization should be and to initiate any change programs needed to achieve them. In Teal, as long as people’s actions are being guided by their “listening” to the organization’s purpose and sensing/responding to changes in the environment, there is no need for "change management".
