  每个组织都需要编制财务预算并监控其绩效，以便控制运营过程并确认目标和指标的实现完成情况。本文论述了如何制定、监控预算，以及如何使用控制流程来达成结果。

  组织向蔚蓝模式转型时，预算可能是一个更具挑战性的领域。蔚蓝的做法是感知和应对当前的状况，而不是试图通过预算和其他手段来控制，这与橙色甚至绿色的做法明显不同。从蔚蓝的角度来看，制定预算而带来的控制可能会阻碍组织的感知并进行真实反应的能力。

  每一个历史阶段都产生了对预算和控制的不同观点和实践方式：


  #### 红色组织


  目前我们所理解的预算和控制概念，还没有出现在[Red 红色组织](../red-organizations/) 中。他们的计划往往是短期的，因当时制定长期战略的能力很有限。红色的重点通常是对新的威胁或机遇进行回应，以便榨取或从中获利。


  #### 琥珀组织


  [琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)依赖稳定而可复制的流程。它们还创建了明确定义的结构和等级制度。这些特征加在一起，使得项目和计划的交付规模能力比红色组织大得多。琥珀为实现一些能充分理解并可预测的目标，而通过规划和预算确定所需资源。计划是一个自上而下的过程，完成的预算会下放到组织的更下级层面。


  #### 橙色组织


  在[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，最高管理者负责决定组织的战略和方向。然后将这些计划层次分解为等级结构更下级单元的目标和指标。为了达到预期目标，每一级经理都会制定必要的计划和预算。这通常是个年度预算流程。计划通常包括支出预算（成本中心）或目标收入（利润中心），以及投资预算。然后各级指标被分层下推到每个单位和团队，允许目标管理：只要实现这些预算目标，每个团队都有一定的自由来决定如何实现。


  预算和控制，与橙色的“预测和控制”主题的管理方法密切相关。年度预算细分为半年、季度或月度计划。会计和财务部门在每个周期结束时跟踪这些数字，并比较结果与计划。当结果与预测不符时，管理者常常被要求解释差距，并提出纠正措施。


  #### 绿色组织


  [绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)通常对财务主导的绩效管理做法感到不安。虽然仍在使用“预测和控制”方法，但其他非财务指标（例如，成员敬业度和客户满意度）也被放在同样重要的位置。预算编制与橙色组织类似，但考虑的要素可能会更广泛，并通过“自下而上”和“自上而下”并用的方法来达成一致。


  #### Teal Organizations


  蔚蓝组织的计划和预算方法，与传统管理思想中所习惯采用的最佳流程大相径庭。蔚蓝组织不试图预测和控制，而是尽可能多地感知和响应环境。通常使用简化的预算，目的是为了获得信息，而不是为了实施控制才跟踪计实差异。制定预算的目的是出于实际需要，例如协调资源，确保现金流良好，确保财务义务和负债得到偿付。

  #### 简化预算、不跟踪预实差异


  许多传统的组织每年都要经历一个痛苦的预算周期，来制定控制组织绩效的计划。


  但在蔚蓝组织中，只有在需要用预测支撑重要决策时，才制定预算，例如：


  * 资源的协调或获取：例如，在[法维](http://www.favi.com/)，团队为了却确保原材料进货合同，而每年一次制定粗略的分月预测。

  * 确保良好的现金流以及财务义务的履行。


  蔚蓝组织有时也需要制定现实性预算，目的是预见问题并履行义务。布尔佐格的单个团队不需要进行任何重大的采购或投资，因此不需要团队预算。但在组织整体层面上，对其预期现金流做了一个简单的预测（可以缩短在一页纸内），目的是用来了解来年能允许成立多少个新团队（发展投资）。因新团队可能需要长达一年的时间来实现盈亏平衡，所以希望确保它们能够得到支持和持续。


  除了这些原因之外，许多蔚蓝组织发现根本不需要做任何预算。[太阳液压](http://www.sunhydraulics.com/)就不做预算（如果董事会要求预算，就做一个可以容纳在一页纸内的粗略预算）。


  #### 有同行监督但无管控


  即使团队制定预算，也不会有来自上层的指手画脚。无论团队预测什么数字都会成为预算。一些公司发现，同行团队互相质疑预算的方法很有益。按照[自我管理](../self-management/)的精神，没有人可以强迫一个团队改变他们的人数。例如，在晨星，各单元团队向预算工作组提交预算和投资计划。预算小组由来自企业各个部门的志愿者组成，负责对收到的预算数字提出质疑，并提出意见和建议。[AES](http://www.aes.com/)过去也有类似的流程。


  #### 无“自上而下”的指标


  蔚蓝组织不设定任何自上而下的指标。例如，[FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) for example have no targets to reach. From an Evolutionary-Teal perspective, targets are problematic for at least three reasons;


  * they rest on the assumption that we can predict the future,

  * they skew our behavior away from inner motivation, and

  * they tend to narrow our capacity to sense new possibilities.


  From a Teal perspective, life is complex and events and circumstances change so fast, that setting a target is mostly guesswork. A year after a target has been set, in most cases it is just an arbitrary number―either so easy to reach as to be meaningless or so challenging that people must take shortcuts. Both circumstances hurt the organization in the long run.


  Targets and in particular budget and sales targets also skew our behavior. In many companies managers often spend any budget left at the end of the year, sometimes on meaningless items, for fear that their funding might be cut in the following year. Without targets, these games disappear. People are free to tap into their inner motivation to simply do the best job they can.


  In [self-managing](../self-management/) organizations, people can choose to set themselves targets when they find it useful―rather like a hobby runner who spurs herself on by extending her goals. At [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/), operators set themselves target times to machine their pieces, and they monitor their performance against that target.


  Targets provide guidance when they are well understood. They become problematic when circumstances change and they do not change in response.


  #### Letting go of the desire to control


  Predictions are valuable in world that can be controllled, but lose relevance in a complex world that is changing rapidly. Setting budgets and managing against them is a way of trying to predict the future.


  Teal organizations make peace with a complex world by understanding that a perfect solution is rarely possible. Determing a workable solution that can be implemented quickly is far more effective than waiting for detailed analysis before taking action. When new information emerges, the decision can be revisited and improved at any point. From this perspective, creating budgets for long periods ahead, and trying to exercise control makes little sense.


  Companies that work this way, make many fast iterations instead of a few mighty leaps, progressing much faster towards their purpose. In the end, paradoxically, people often feel safer when they give up the illusion of control and learn to work with reality as it unfolds.
faq:
  - question: How do we manage spending and cash flow if there are no budgets that
      set limits?
    answer: >-
      In most cases, the advice process takes care of keeping spending in line
      with the needs of the organization.  An expenditure that would be fanciful
      or that would be one person's pet project tends not to survive the advice
      process (if it does, another person can initiate another advice process to
      make a correction, or it too late, engage in a [conflict resolution
      process](../conflict-resolution/)).  Another factor tends to tame
      spending: in traditional organizations, managers often measure their
      importance with the size of their budget, and therefore often fight to
      increase their budget, and make sure to spend whatever budget was
      allocated to them).  Self-managing organizations don't measure their
      importance with the size of their budget, which reduced much unnecessary
      spending. 


      If, however, for some reason an organization feels it needs to keep its spending below what would naturally happen with the advice process (because the organization is cash-strapped, or because there are more opportunities to pursue than cash available), a budget process can be established as a means to have a conversation about spending priorities. In practice, such processes can be set up in ways that are similar to those used to determine [investment](../purchasing-and-investments/) budgets.
  - question: Some type of budgeting might be necessary to ensure the operation of a
      production line for example?
    answer: >-
      In keeping with the general principle of "form follows function"; if
      colleagues feel a need for a budget, then by any means, establish a
      budget.  If a production line feels it needs a cost budget, colleagues can
      convene and create it.


      Before establishing such a budget, it's worthwhile wondering: why do we need a budget?  Often the answer is simply "to control our costs".  In many cases, in order to control your costs, you don't need to ***anticipate*** the future with a budget.  It's enough to measure and monitor your cost ***after the facts*** on a recurring basis - say every month.


      We are so used to budgets, and the illusion of control they provide, that we might simply establish a budget out of habit, because we feel naked in the absence of budgets.  The key question is: "what's the kind of decision we need to take for which we need a budget?".  A budget is needed only if it helps anticipate, if the presence of a budget would lead to a different decision on a specific decision.
