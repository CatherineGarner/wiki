intro: "This article discusses the structures through which people coordinate
  work and distribute power in Teal organizations.\r\n"
perspective: 'All organizations prior to Teal were structured as pyramids for a
  simple reason: it is a natural consequence of the boss-subordinate
  relationship. In self-managed organizations, peer commitments replace the
  boss-subordinate relationship, and the pyramid disappears. Authority is
  distributed, and work is conducted by decentralized, self-managing teams or
  networks. The static hierarchy of the pyramid gives way to fluid natural
  hierarchies, where influence flows to people who have the most expertise,
  passion or interest. Freed from the rigidity and sluggishness of a command and
  control structure, Teal organizations can be more responsive and more
  energized. They are “emergent”: the behavior of the organization ‘emerges’
  from the actions of teams and individuals.^[Teal organizations can be thought
  of as an example of a “complex adaptive system”: a "complex macroscopic
  collection" of relatively "similar and partially connected micro-structures"
  formed in order to adapt to the changing environment and increase its
  survivability as a macro-structure. They are complex in that they are dynamic
  networks of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the
  individual static entities. They are adaptive in that the individual and
  collective behaviors mutate and self-organize corresponding to the
  change-initiating micro-event or collection of events." Source: Complex

  Although the pyramid disappears in Teal, it would be a mistake to think that
  self-managing organizations are simply flat and structureless. Teal
  organizations to date seem to fall into three broad types of structure to fit
  the context in which they operate. These are described further below. However
  all share the common attributes of distributed authority and natural
  hierarchies.


  #### Distributed authority


  In traditional organizations, when power is concentrated at the top, bosses can approve or invalidate a decision made by a subordinate. In Teal organizations, power is distributed There are no bosses, only coaches. Anyone who senses a problem or an opportunity can initiate a decision making process, using methods that leverage the collective intelligence of the organization.

  #### Archetypes of structure


  Self-managing organizations adopt different forms to fit the context in which they operate. There seem to be three broad types of self-managing structures that have emerged so far: 


  1. Parallel teams 

  2. Web of individual contracting

  3. Nested circles 


  These structures are not mutually exclusive, and some organizations exhibit a mixture of these types.


  ![Michael K Sahota - 30 mai 2015 à 21:12](/media/parallel_teams.png "Parallel Teams") This is the most common structure found to date in Teal organizations.^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 319.]Examples would include Buurtzorg (geographic teams) and FAVI (client teams) (see “Concrete examples for inspiration” below). This model is highly suitable when work can be broken down in ways that teams have a high degree of autonomy, without too much need for coordination across teams. They can then work side by side. In this model, it is within the team that colleagues define their roles and the mutual commitments they make to each other. Teams also typically handle their own recruitment, planning, establish their investment needs, devise a budget (if a budget is needed), track their financial and non-financial results, and so on.


  In an ideal situation, each team is fully autonomous and performing all tasks from start to finish. When that is the case, every single person in the organization has the satisfaction of seeing the entire organization’s purpose come to life, and not just a small slice of it as is often the case in large specialized organizations. In practice, there will often be a need for some people or teams who take on coordinating or supporting roles with a more narrow focus:


  * *Team coaches:* In Teal Organizations, there are no middle managers. But teams often feel a need to be supported by someone external that can help them work through problems. At Buurtzorg, they are called regional coaches; at RHD, hub leaders.

  * *Supporting teams*: For some tasks, duplication in every team doesn’t make sense. At FAVI, for example, the great majority of teams are client facing―the Audi team, the Volkswagen team, etc. However, a few teams support other teams, such as the foundry team. It would not be practical for the teams to operate the foundry in turns, nor would it make sense to duplicate the equipment and have a foundry within each team. RHD has units responsible for areas such as training (its “miniversity”), real estate, and payroll, that support all the units in the field.

  * *Supporting roles:* The self-management model pushes expertise down to the teams, rather than up into staff functions. But for certain specific expertise or for coordination purposes, creating a supporting role can make sense. At FAVI, for instance, there is an engineer who helps teams exchange innovations and best practices.
