  This article discusses the structures through which people coordinate work and
  distribute power in Teal organizations.

perspective: 'All organizations prior to Teal were structured as pyramids for a
  simple reason: it is a natural consequence of the boss-subordinate
  relationship. In self-managed organizations, peer commitments replace the
  boss-subordinate relationship, and the pyramid disappears. Authority is
  distributed, and work is conducted by decentralized, self-managing teams or
  networks. The static hierarchy of the pyramid gives way to fluid natural
  hierarchies, where influence flows to people who have the most expertise,
  passion or interest. Freed from the rigidity and sluggishness of a command and
  control structure, Teal organizations can be more responsive and more
  energized. They are “emergent”: the behavior of the organization ‘emerges’
  from the actions of teams and individuals.^[Teal organizations can be thought
  of as an example of a “complex adaptive system”: a "complex macroscopic
  collection" of relatively "similar and partially connected micro-structures"
  formed in order to adapt to the changing environment and increase its
  survivability as a macro-structure. They are complex in that they are dynamic
  networks of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the
  individual static entities. They are adaptive in that the individual and
  collective behaviors mutate and self-organize corresponding to the
  change-initiating micro-event or collection of events." Source: Complex
  Adaptive Systems, Wikipedia,

  Although the pyramid disappears in Teal, it would be a mistake to think that
  self-managing organizations are simply flat and structureless. Teal
  organizations to date seem to fall into three broad types of structure to fit
  the context in which they operate. These are described further below. However
  all share the common attributes of distributed authority and natural
  hierarchies.


  #### Distributed authority 


  In traditional organizations, when power is concentrated at the top, bosses can approve or invalidate a decision made by a subordinate. In Teal organizations, power is distributed There are no bosses, only coaches. Anyone who senses a problem or an opportunity can initiate a decision making process, using methods that leverage the collective intelligence of the organization.

  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      #### Self-management


      Teal organizational structures are driven by self-management. The traditional boss-subordinate relationship gives way to a decentralized team structure and peer to peer commitments.


      #### Wholeness


      Pyramidal structures are built on the (often unconscious) assumption that people cannot be trusted and must be controlled by their hierarchical superior. In Teal organizational structures, people are freed from the constraints of authority and can thus show up more fully.


      #### Evolutionary purpose


      In Teal organizations, people’s actions are guided by their sense of the organization’s evolutionary purpose, not by what they are being told to do by someone higher up the organizational chain. Self-managing systems, based on sense and respond as opposed to command and control, tend to evolve much faster and respond more quickly to changes in the environment. Pyramidal organizations tend to change through less frequent, less timely and more brutal re-organizations.
