intro: "This article discusses the structures through which people coordinate
  work and distribute power in Teal organizations.\r\n"
perspective: 'All organizations prior to Teal were structured as pyramids for a
  simple reason: it is a natural consequence of the boss-subordinate
  relationship. In self-managed organizations, peer commitments replace the
  boss-subordinate relationship, and the pyramid disappears. Authority is
  distributed, and work is conducted by decentralized, self-managing teams or
  networks. The static hierarchy of the pyramid gives way to fluid natural
  hierarchies, where influence flows to people who have the most expertise,
  passion or interest. Freed from the rigidity and sluggishness of a command and
  control structure, Teal organizations can be more responsive and more
  energized. They are “emergent”: the behavior of the organization ‘emerges’
  from the actions of teams and individuals.^[Teal organizations can be thought
  of as an example of a “complex adaptive system”: a "complex macroscopic
  collection" of relatively "similar and partially connected micro-structures"
  formed in order to adapt to the changing environment and increase its
  survivability as a macro-structure. They are complex in that they are dynamic
  networks of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the
  individual static entities. They are adaptive in that the individual and
  collective behaviors mutate and self-organize corresponding to the
  change-initiating micro-event or collection of events." Source: Complex

  Although the pyramid disappears in Teal, it would be a mistake to think that self-managing organizations are simply flat and structureless. Teal organizations to date seem to fall into three broad types of structure to fit the context in which they operate. These are described further below. However all share the common attributes of distributed authority and natural hierarchies.


  #### Distributed authority


  In traditional organizations, when power is concentrated at the top, bosses can approve or invalidate a decision made by a subordinate. In Teal organizations, power is distributed There are no bosses, only coaches. Anyone who senses a problem or an opportunity can initiate a decision making process, using methods that leverage the collective intelligence of the organization.

  #### Archetypes of structure


  Self-managing organizations adopt different forms to fit the context in which they operate. There seem to be three broad types of self-managing structures that have emerged so far: 


  1. Parallel teams 

  2. Web of individual contracting

  3. Nested circles 


  These structures are not mutually exclusive, and some organizations exhibit a mixture of these types.
