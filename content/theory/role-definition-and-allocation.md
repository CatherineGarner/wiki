intro: 本文描述在蔚蓝组织中如何定义和分配岗位角色。
perspective: >-
  在蔚蓝组织内，由成员担任的各种岗位角色根据当下需求创建，交换和终止。在不同特点的蔚蓝组织中，运用方法各有不同:有些用精确文档描述，有些则只是采用非正式的记录。


  蔚蓝模式的特点和效果包括：


  * 没有组织结构图，没有等级结构

  * 没有正式的晋升程序

  * 每个人同时承诺担任多个不同的角色

  * 没有固定的职称定义和工作描述

  * 传统的管理任务，如计划、监督、招聘、入职、辅导等，都分散在项目中由普通组员分享承担。

  * 个人的岗位角色随着技能和认可尊重的提高而进化

  * 为新同事创造机会


  作为比较，这里概括一下传统组织的岗位角色定义和分配：


  #### 红色组织


  在 [红色组织](../red-organizations/) 中，在红色组织中，小组成员的地位由他们与领导者的距离来呈现。角色分配由酋长（或他的亲密盟友）决定。如果不符合领导的意愿，很可能会失去地位。靠忠诚和成功赢得更多的权力。与领导人的家族裙带关系也可能决定成员的地位。


  #### 琥珀组织


  [琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)的典型特征是，具有正式的结构图、等级和头衔。角色和晋升都基于正式流程。通过下列角度来体现特权：


  * 高职位成员的个人意见

  * 具体标准（如服务年限、职称或资格）

  * 特定社会团体或阶级、种姓或性别


  #### 橙色组织


  [橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中的固定岗位角色，都绑定在组织结构图的各个方框中，并记录在“职务描述”里。多数岗位角色的功能，都部分或全部集中于“管理”层之下。因此，角色与资历、头衔和晋升挂钩。


  岗位定义还与一些相关流程交织运作。比如继任计划、工作轮换和人才管理。这种流程的设计目的是，培养能担任未来管理岗位的“高潜力”成员。


  #### Green Organizations


  [绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)的岗位角色处理方式与橙色组织基本相似。但不同点是，通过鼓励管理者充当仆人领导，来缓和对“管理”的重视。在一些公司，下属可以自己推选部门经理。

  #### 重视角色而非工作


  在自我管理的组织中，不存在固定的工作定义，组织结构图上没有固定的“岗位方框”，没有层级管理，因此成员也无需通过天梯正式晋升到某个阶层的“方框”中。相反，每个同事担任多个他/她自愿同意并承诺要履行的角色。传统的经理任务（预测、计划、监控、招聘、入职、辅导等）通常分散在团队的各个成员中。成员经验增长后，会逐步承担起更大的责任岗位，并将较简单的工作交给新员工或更初级的同事。


  #### 如何定义角色


  有些组织采用非正式流程定义一些非正式的角色。有些组织则制定较正式的程序。


  ##### 非正式角色定义


  在一些蔚蓝公司，每个普通成员如果感觉到创建、修改或取消一个角色的需要时，就会主动站出来，通过建议流程与相关人员协商，并做出决定。


  如果该蔚蓝组织是由单元团队组陈，那么进行这种角色管理对话的自然场所就是团队内部会议。如果有角色延伸到团队之外，发起人可以召集跨团队会议，进行数次一对一的沟通，或者在组织内部社交网络上分享建议。


  ##### Formal role definition


  Other companies have formal processes for defining roles. Here are two: the first involving a team-based conversation, the other, one-to-one exchanges:


  *Team-based conversation*: Holacracy is an organizational "operating system", that uses specific "Governance meetings" dedicated to the creation, modification and cessation of roles. Usually these are held monthly. Every voice is heard and no one can dominate decision-making. Organizations using Holacracy find that every month a team will typically adapt, clarify, create, or discard roles. (Note: A person has multiple roles.)


  *One-on-one conversations*: Morning Star uses a formal, one-on-one contracting system. Each colleague completes a document for every working relationship. Because Morning Star operates a highly efficient, non-stop process (in which each stage relies on the one before and after), precision is necessary. It would be inefficient to stop the line for a colleague conference. The document that describes these mutual commitments is called a Colleague Letter of Understanding. When summed, these detail all roles and commitments. In effect, these are "contracts", negotiated with the handful or two of colleagues they work with most closely. They are refined and agreed directly, one-on-one. Because minor improvements can have significant impacts, it makes sense to define roles with great granularity, and to track indicators closely.


  #### How roles get allocated


  There can be various degrees of formality in the process of how roles are allocated to colleagues, but they all essentially involve peer consultation and agreement. Roles with more responsibility and scope (which typically are rewarded with higher compensation) tend to be given to colleagues who have built up a reputation to be capable, helpful and trustworthy.


  ##### Informal role allocation


  When a new role is created, in many cases there is a obvious candidate that emerges naturally. It might be the person who sensed the need for the new role, or another team member that everyone sees as the natural person to fill the role. Often, very little discussion is needed. A simple question in a team meeting ("Who feels like taking on this role?" or "I feel Catherine would be the be the natural person to take on this role, what do you think?") is all that is needed.


  ##### Formal role allocation


  In some cases, several candidates express heavy interest in the same role and a more formal process might be called for: 


  * *Interviews*: Candidates may be interviewed by those who will work closely with them.  Interviewers can choose to decide on the winning candidate using a number of [decision making](../decision-making/) mechanisms, such as consensus, majority vote or the advice process. 

  * *Elections*: [Sociocracy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy)and [Holacracy ](http://www.holacracy.org/)use a consent-based election process for certain roles. Colleagues nominate their preferred candidates. A facilitator then helps the group to decide.

  * *Advice Process*: One person (for instance, the person who sensed the need for the new role, or someone others trust to lead this process well) steps forward and seeks advice for who would be the best person to fill a new role before making a decision.

  * *Designated Authority*: Allocating roles can be a role itself: in Holacracy, the "Lead Link" is a role that comes, among other, with the authority to allocate operational roles. 


  #### Trading roles


  Because roles are granular, it is easy to trade roles within a team. A person who is overly busy can ask someone to pick up one of his or her roles, either temporarily or permanently. Someone who wants to acquire a new skill can ask a colleague to trade a role. HolacracyOne has a "role market place" to facilitate this process.


  #### Scope of responsibility


  In Teal Organizations, while people have clear roles and responsibilities, their concerns need not be limited to these. They can take the well-being of the whole organization to heart. Then, via the [advice process](../decision-making/), anyone can take action if they sense an issue. As there are no bosses, there is no one to say, “That is none of your business.”


  [Morning Star](http://morningstarco.com/) talks about "total responsibility”. All colleagues are obliged to do something when they sense an issue, even if it’s outside the scope of their roles. That usually means talking about the problem or opportunity with a colleague whose role does relate to the topic. It’s considered unacceptable to say: “Somebody should do something about this problem”, and leave it at that.
faq:
  - question: Why do we need roles? Can't we work without formalizing any roles?
    answer: "By the very nature of the division of labor in organizations, people
      end up taking up certain roles. Colleagues often feel a need for clarity
      around these roles, for example \"I need help with X: who can I talk
      to?\", \"I have an idea to change something in this domain: who would be
      the natural person to make that happen?\", \"We agreed to do something
      that didn't get done: who was the person that committed to this?\". \r

      \r

      There is value, therefore, in creating clarity on roles and
      commitments.  Some people can be allergic to any formality or clarity, as
      it reminds them of traditional, static hierarchies, job titles and job
      definitions.  Remember, roles can be fluidly created, modified, exchanged
      and scrapped, using peer-based rather than top-down processes. "
  - question: What kind of "management" roles can be given to team members?
    answer: >-
      In traditional organizations, managers act on behalf of those below them.
      Many such ‘management’ tasks disappear in self-managing organizations.
      Those that are still needed can be distributed among team members. For
      example:


      * *Anticipating*: Everyone can anticipate the future, but some teams might find it useful to have one person dedicate time to anticipate the need for long term changes.

      * *Planning*: This can be further broken down, for instance into shift planning, raw material planning, etc. 
        Setting objectives: Individuals and teams can set objectives to spur themselves on. One person can take the lead using the advice process. 
      * *Monitoring performance indicators*: Compiling data into easy to understand insights to share with the team.

      * *Recruiting*: Taking the lead in the recruitment process of new team members.

      * *On-boarding:* Taking the lead in organizing the on-boarding of new team members.

      * *Coaching*: Coaching junior team members, or anyone asking for coaching.

      * *Mediating*: Mediating conflicts.

      * *Facilitating*: Facilitating team meetings and decision making processes.

      * *Scribe*: Documenting important conversations and decisions of the team.

      * *Knowledge management*: Capturing and codifying  insights.

      * *Continuous improvement*: Taking the lead in maintaining processes for continuous improvement.

      * *Coordinating with outside parties*: Being the contact person for certain constituencies outside of the team ("I'm coordinating with the marketing team") or outside the organization ("I'm coordinating with hospitals, you are liaising with pharmacies"). 

      * *Sensing team mood*: Sensing how the team as a whole and persons within the team feel, and initiate conversations when needed.

      * *Organizing social events*: Creating events that build community feeling.


      The advice process is the basis for which to make decision in these roles.
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      #### Self-management


      The ability to craft a role that caters to one’s strengths not only has the potential to strengthen the organization, it is a clear example of managing one’s self. There are no managers or bosses in Teal organizations that decide roles, Rather roles are self-determined with the consent of peers.


      #### Wholeness


      Equally, it is evident that the better the match between a person’s strengths/interests and their role, the more likely it is they can express themselves fully and freely via work.


      #### Evolutionary purpose


      When processes and a culture exists that help roles evolve continuously, it helps the organization adapt and support its evolving purpose.
