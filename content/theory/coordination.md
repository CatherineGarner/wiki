  In Teal organizations, the need for coordination does not go away. However,
  the bosses, staff roles and endless meetings typically used to accomplish such
  coordination in earlier stages are replaced by more ad hoc and organic
  processes, including direct agreements and commitments between colleagues, ad
  hoc meetings, conversations on internal social networks, as well as people
  holding specific roles to support coordination. The advice process for making
  decisions is also fundamental to coordination in Teal.

inPractice: "In a pyramid structure, meetings are needed at every level to
  gather, package, filter, and transmit information as it flows up and down the
  chain of command. In self-managing structures, the need for these meetings
  falls away almost entirely. Meeting overload in traditional organizations is
  particularly acute the higher you go up the hierarchy. The typical day of a
  top manager consists of back-to-back meetings. The joke goes that in most
  organizations, people low in the hierarchy work, while people higher up do
  meetings. In functional pyramidal structures, it could hardly be otherwise.
  The higher you go, the more lines converge. It is only at the very top that
  the different departments such as sales, marketing, R&D, production, HR, and
  finance meet. Decisions are naturally pushed up to the top, as it’s the only
  place where decisions and tradeoffs can be informed from the various angles
  involved. It’s almost deterministic: with a pyramidal shape, people at the top
  of organizations will complain about meeting overload, while people below feel
  disempowered.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A
