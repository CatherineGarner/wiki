  exchanging knowledge across the organization.\r

perspective: >+
  In Teal organizations, the need for coordination does not go away. However,
  the bosses, staff roles and endless meetings typically used to accomplish such
  coordination in earlier stages are replaced by more ad hoc and organic
  processes, including direct agreements and commitments between colleagues, ad
  hoc meetings, conversations on internal social networks, as well as people
  holding specific roles to support coordination. The advice process for making
  decisions is also fundamental to coordination in Teal.

inPractice: >-
  In a pyramid structure, meetings are needed at every level to gather, package,
  filter, and transmit information as it flows up and down the chain of command.
  In self-managing structures, the need for these meetings falls away almost
  entirely. Meeting overload in traditional organizations is particularly acute
  the higher you go up the hierarchy. The typical day of a top manager consists
  of back-to-back meetings. The joke goes that in most organizations, people low
  in the hierarchy work, while people higher up do meetings. In functional
  pyramidal structures, it could hardly be otherwise. The higher you go, the
  more lines converge. It is only at the very top that the different departments
  such as sales, marketing, R&D, production, HR, and finance meet. Decisions are
  naturally pushed up to the top, as it’s the only place where decisions and
  tradeoffs can be informed from the various angles involved. It’s almost
  deterministic: with a pyramidal shape, people at the top of organizations will
  complain about meeting overload, while people below feel
  disempowered.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A

  TO BE COMPLETED


  #### Direct agreements and commitments

  The simplest form of coordination is simply one colleague speaking with another colleague – whatever their role and place in the organization. In the absence of hierarchical structures, no colleague is out of bounds. No superior needs to be informed when a colleague wants to reach out to another colleague.

  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      #### Self-management


      Since coordination is largely organic and voluntary rather than imposed through hierarchy, these practices support the Teal breakthrough of self-management.


      #### Wholeness


      Similarly, since coordination under Teal is voluntary, any individual is free to promote coordination of efforts in a way that he or she sees fit and that meshes with his or her talents and interests.


      #### Evolutionary purpose


      The Teal approach to coordination allows an organization to function as a living system with its own sense for direction. Employees are coordinated as all their actions are guided by listening to the organization’s purpose. Trust in the collective intelligence of the system does away, in many cases, with the need for a master plan.
