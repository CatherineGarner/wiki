  ## 新视角


  从橙色范式开始，企业根据客户有意识和无意识的需求、偏好和购买行为，对客户进行细分。这方面技巧已经变得非常成熟。出于战胜竞争对手的目标，传统组织根据每个细分市场，致力于细心定位自己的产品和服务。这些努力和实践，在橙色和绿色组织产品创新角度起到很大作用。但在已经成熟的市场中，似乎越来越多的公司为了经济利益而致力于创造新的（伪）需求，不能立足于更好满足现有的需求。企业在这个需求诱惑过程中，主要是在利用人性的恐惧和虚荣。“买这个，你会对自己感觉良好。”“买这个，别人会喜欢你。”“买这个，你就会成功。”


  In contrast, the Teal approach to marketing is rather simplistic and stems directly from the organization’s sense of purpose. Companies simply ‘listen in’ to what feels like the right offering. There is less emphasis on customer surveys and focus groups. Essentially, marketing boils down to: This is our offer. At this moment, we feel this is the best we can possibly do. We hope you will like it. In a strange paradox, Teal organizations go about filling a need not by tuning in to the noise of the world (the surveys, the focus groups, the customer segmentation), but by listening within. What product would we be really proud of? What product would fill a genuine need in the world? These are the kinds of questions people in Teal organizations ask to define new products. It’s a process guided by beauty and intuition more than analytics.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  As an organization’s guiding light switches from sales, profits and market
  share to its purpose, sales and marketing practices change in fundamental
  ways.


  ### Inside-out offer defined by purpose


  Earlier stage organizations will develop marketing strategies based heavily on an analysis of customers (using surveys, focus groups, etc.) with the objective of increasing sales, profit, market share, etc. often by creating artificial needs. This could be characterized as an “outside in” approach. Teal organizations take an “inside out” approach where product development and communication are driven by the desire to fulfill the organization’s purpose. See also[ Innovation and Product Development](../innovation-and-product-development/).  


  ### Marketing driven more by purpose than product


  Because purpose takes priority over sales and profits in Teal, these organizations are most interested in promoting the importance of their purpose and how they are working to achieve it than they are on selling their product or service. See the example of Patagonia below.


  ### The message is less directed at the “competition”


  Communications about a Teal company’s offering are less frequently designed primarily to claim superiority over the competition. As noted elsewhere in this wiki, Teal organizations often view others that are pursuing a similar purpose as allies rather than competitors. Communication are more often focused on the importance of the organization’s purpose and how the offering fulfills that purpose.


  ### Less investment in sales and marketing departments


  In Teal, the massive resources allocated to marketing typical in earlier stage organizations are largely gone. Traditional sales and marketing departments often do not exist. Responsibility is distributed throughout the organisation through self-managing teams who have direct customer contact. Within project teams there is often a role which links directly to the customer and is responsible for communicating with him and feeding back issues or opportunities to the team.


  ### Fewer top-down sales targets


  In Teal organizations, self-set targets may exist, but top-down targets usually don't. Targets are problematic for at least three reasons:


  1. They rest on the assumption that we can predict the future.

  2. They may skew our focus away from purpose.

  3. They may narrow our ability to sense possibilities.
