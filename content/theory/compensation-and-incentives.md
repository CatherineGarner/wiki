  ## 新视角


  在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，不仅确定薪酬的方式不同，薪酬的性质和重要性都变得完全不同。蔚蓝组织在薪酬方面通常表现出以下特征：


  * 成员以同事为标尺决定自己的工资。

  * 基本没有个人或团队激励。因为蔚蓝认为，激励会分散人们对内在动机的注意力，并导致行为脱逸目标。

  * 不一定要刻意建立一个明确的平等性薪酬结构。蔚蓝组织似乎在努力减少薪酬差距，在当今在许多传统组织中这种差距有时很极端。蔚蓝有一个特别关注的底线，就是确保最低收入者的收入能足以满足生活基本需求。


  作为对比，将早期组织的薪酬和激励总结如下：


  #### **红色组织**


  在[红色模式](../red-organizations/)中，老板的特权是，可以根据突发奇想自由决定增加或减少成员的工资。没有正式的薪酬谈判流程，也没有任何正式的、有文件记录的激励流程。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  在[琥珀模式](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，报酬通常是固定的，并根据成员在等级制度中的级别（或其他固定的地位标志，如个人的学历）来决定。没有个人工资谈判，没有激励措施。“同工同酬”。


  #### **橙色组织**


  在[橙色模式](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，开始出现一些关于基本工资的个人协商，人们一般都适配在某个工资等级。老板有一定的自由，可以在一定范围内增加某人的工资。橙色坚信个人目标和激励措施。如果人们达到预定的目标（一个级联的理想情况下的目标或预算系统，以打造强有力的股东价值创造机器），就能得到坚实的奖金。收入高低的巨大差异被认为是完全可以接受的，因为橙色认为差异是对人们的优点才能和贡献的直接反应。


  #### **绿色组织**


  在[绿色模式](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)相信合作与竞争同样重要：个人激励开始被团队奖金所替代。人们试图缩小职场中收入高低的差距，例如，通过定义首席执行官薪酬与组织中的中等（或最低）工资之间的最大倍数来限制差距。

  ## **实践中**


  #### **谁/如何决定薪酬**


  在传统组织中，薪酬通常根据组织的层次结构决定。一般来说，老板可以决定给下属加薪，但通常需要人力资源（或机构）的咨询或批准。在自我管理的组织中，在没有老板的情况下，工资和其他类型薪酬的决定方法是，利用同类工作的同事做对比衡量而进行调整和设计。似乎有两大类系统：基于排名的系统和基于自我定义（基于建议）的系统。\[这两种方法，并不依赖于自我管理结构，也都可用于等级制度体系中。]


  ##### ***基于分级的薪酬体系***


  在某些公司，如W.L.果尔或霍尔万，由成员就那些自己最密切合作的同事的贡献效果做出排名或评估。根据这个输入，把人们分成不同的工资级别--通常是通过系统算法或选举产生的委员会评议。那些被大家评价为贡献更多的人，会发现自己置身于更高薪水的团队；那些资历较低、经验较少的同事自然会倾向于进入薪水较低的团队。这是一个简单易懂的过程。不仅仅是一个人（老板）来评估，而是由成员的许多同事来影响这个评估过程，所以由此产生的工资会更公平地反映个人的贡献。


  这种制度会导致工资逐年波动（上升或下降），因金额取决于人们的贡献。在许多国家，劳动法禁止工资下降，于是需要对这种方法进行调整改进。例如，把系统改进成只用来辨别哪些同事应该加薪。或者，采用一个设置了最低固定工资的系统，波动主要通过个人奖金来实现，就可以上升或下降。


  ##### （基于建议的）自定系统


  蔚蓝中更具主流的做法是人们自己定工资，并根据同事的建议来调整。通常一年一次，人们会提出自认适合自己的加薪方式，并附加这个建议的理由。这些输入由许多同事（例如，一个选举出来的薪资建议小组）审核，小组根据同事之间的对比，对该提案给出个人建议。提出的成员有权选择是否遵循这些收到的建议，并将自己的选择决定公之于众。如果薪资建议组对此有异议，还可以选择报告一个冲突的发生，并调用蔚蓝预制的[冲突解决流程](../conflict-resolution/)。


  The process cuts through much of the haggling, strategizing, complaining, and "sucking up" that happens when salaries are set by one's boss. If people are unhappy with their salary, they can simply raise it. And they will face the consequences of their choices, if they decide to place themselves too far outside their peers' advice.


  #### **Use of incentives**


  In the Teal paradigm, people value intrinsic over extrinsic motivators. Once people make enough money to cover their basic needs, what matters most is that work is meaningful and that they can express their talents and callings at work. In the book *Drive*, Daniel Pink concludes from a great amount of research on the matter that in today’s complex work settings, incentives are mostly counterproductive, reducing rather than enhancing people’s performance.


  The consequence is that Teal Organizations generally operate without explicit financial incentives at individual and team level. No one, not even sales people, has targets or incentives and there are rarely individual bonuses or stock options. Instead, at the end of very profitable years, some part of the profit will be shared with all employees (in some cases everyone receives the same fixed percent of base salary, in others everyone receives the same fixed amount). See also [Ownership](../ownership/).


  #### **Compensation inequality**


  Without the use of bonuses and stock options, compensation inequality is automatically reduced, as a large share of the pay inequalities in today's Fortune 500 companies stem from the often extravagant CEO bonuses and stock options. Some organizations also strive consciously to limit inequality in the base salary. Some organizations, like AES and FAVI, have replaced hourly wages with monthly salaries for shop floor operators, erasing the distinction between blue- and white-collar workers. Everyone is compensated on the same principles.
faq:
  - question: When salaries are self-set, how can salary inflation be prevented?
    answer: >-
      The advice process (and if needed the conflict resolution mechanism)
      generally prevents a situation where one individual gets a raise that
      would be disproportionately high. But one might then ask "what prevents a
      sort of (even unconscious) collusion whereby everyone grants themselves
      big raises, thereby inflating the entire payroll of the organization to a
      degree where it might hurt shareholders or even the organizations
      purpose?" This doesn't seem to be a problem with the pioneering
      organizations that use self-set pay. Here is how they seem to go about it.


      * In some organizations (such as Morning Star in California), everyone needs to benchmark their salaries to a market rate. They institute a rule of thumb, for example, that salaries shouldn't be higher than 110% of the industry average. They might support this with the arguments that if salaries are too high, this allows for less investment and future development, makes the organization less able to achieve its purpose or is unfair to the shareholders.

      * Many of the organizations researched are very profitable, and pay out a lot in profit sharing (workers at FAVI typically make the equivalent of 17 or 18 months of salary this way). The idea, therefore, is to keep compensation in line with the industry, and when profits allow, top up the salary with profit sharing. This reduces the incentive to try and increase one's base salary, knowing also that in bad times, jobs are more secure if the base salaries aren't inflated.

      * Some organizations (like FAVI in the north of France) find it useful to have a simple rule of thumb for the organization overall: Revenues should break down into X% for salaries, Y% for material costs, Z% for investments so that a healthy P% of profit remains. Everyone seems to accept this rule as good common sense. This is the basis for what can be shared in profit sharing. If needed, the salary advice group could share these parameters with everyone upfront, for instance in years with low profitability.
  - question: Should we make all salary information transparent?
    answer: >-
      When some information is secret, it tends to generate rumors. For what
      reason would salary information be made a secret? Probably because of the
      idea that some people would be shocked by some of the information and
      claim the salary distribution is not fair.


      From a Teal perspective, such discussions shouldn't be feared and avoided, but can be steered in productive ways. They can help bring to light unspoken issues and hidden grievances. They can help people grow as part of the process, in dealing with their relations to one another and to money. And perhaps, indeed, to correct some obviously unfair situations that might have slipped in over time.


      For this reason, many organizations choose to make information totally public. (The social media app maker Buffer even publishes everyone's salary online). Some organizations, like the tomato-processing company Morning Star, have chosen to make the *salary increase percentages* public within the organization, but not the base salary. That might be an intermediary step towards full transparency for an organization to take.
  - question: What happens in times of crisis?
    answer: >-
      There are several documented examples of self-managing organizations where
      colleagues have voluntarily decided to temporarily reduce their salaries
      to weather a downturn so as to avoid having to lay-off staff. In
      self-managing organizations, all [information tends to be
      public](../information-flow/) and there is generally a high level of
      maturity and literacy when it comes to financial matters. In a traditional
      organization, when revenues are down and the organization faces heavy
      losses, plans are often made secretly within HR for redundancies. In
      self-managing organizations, everyone sees the storm coming. Someone, at
      some point, calls in everyone (or in a large organization, might invite a
      cross-section of the organization) to a meeting to say: what do we do?
      From the group, solutions emerge, which in many cases simply come down to
      everyone agreeing to a temporary salary reduction (with often the highest
      salaries taking a higher percentage cut). 


      Semco, the Brazilian firm that Ricardo Semler's bestseller Maverick made famous, has put in place a "voluntary risk program" to institutionalize such salary reductions to protect the organization in times of crisis (to which Brazil has been prone over the last several decades). Employees are offered the option of a risk salary program. They take a pay cut of 25 percent and then receive a supplement raising their compensation to 125 percent if the company has a good year. If the company does poorly, they only receive 75 percent of their salary. As the good years outweigh the bad, the deal is favorable to employees willing to take a risk.
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      #### **Self-management**


      Self-set or ranking-based salaries are a key enabler to self-management: in traditional hierarchical structures, bosses decide on the salary raises and bonuses of their subordinates; in self-managing systems, it is necessary to upgrade to peer-based compensation mechanisms.


      \[And yet, self-set or ranking-based systems can also be implemented within traditional hierarchical structures. It can be a step towards ultimately replacing hierarchy with self-management. Within an organization where complete self-management isn't in the cards (for instance if the board of directors wouldn't accept that the organization let go of a pyramid structure), it can also be an important step to take some power out of the boss-subordinate relationship and create more of a team-based collaborative spirit.]


      #### **Wholeness**


      When there is one boss that decides over a person's salary, it's tempting to want to please that person, to conform to their expectations, to not speak one's truth. When it's not one person, but a great number of colleagues one works with who calibrate one's salary increase, most people naturally relax into showing up more truthfully. In this way, self-set or ranking based compensation mechanisms help colleagues show up more easily from a place of wholeness.


      They also help us take an adult stance towards compensation. Traditional boss-subordinate relationship tend to push employees to behave like children and bosses like parents. Self-set or ranking based compensation systems also do away, almost instantly, with much of the strategizing, haggling and complaining around compensation, with everyone forced to take an adult-to-adult stance. 


      #### **Evolutionary purpose**


      \[The link between evolutionary purpose and compensation practices can show up in times of crisis. There are several documented cases of self-managing where workers, in a severe downturn, choose voluntarily to reduce their compensations on a temporary basis to avoid lay-offs. In self-managing organizations, colleagues often often have a high level of financial knowledge and maturity, and choose to contribute to save their colleagues jobs and to maintain the organizations ability to pursue its purpose with all its skills and resources.]


      \[Teal organizations are built on the premise that individuals are primarily motivated, after attaining basic needs, by intrinsic factors such as the pursuit of purpose. Thus, they tend not to exhibit the primacy of compensation, including added incentives, typical in Orange or even Green.]
