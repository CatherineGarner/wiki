  本主题探讨蔚蓝组织如何处理反馈和绩效管理。

perspective: >-
  蔚蓝组织固有的透明度，意味着组织的所有成员都能时刻不断地接受反馈。这包括隐含和明确的反馈。隐含反馈指的是，个人能自由获取关于组织整体状态的信息。明确反馈是指，同事之间公开分享他们对其他成员和团队的想法和感受。

  在蔚蓝组织中，成员对努力实现组织[进化目标](../evolutionary-purpose/)的承诺，时刻内在地激励着成员努力工作。绩效主要在团队层面进行，通过同事反馈和效仿竞争来管理。信息和结果都被公开共享，人们能得到信任，所以有权了解组织和其他团队的表现情况。提供反馈是所有人共同的责任，对团队和个人层面的反馈会自动频繁的发生。在蔚蓝组织中，反馈的作用尤其有用，因为这类反馈不带有评判能量，并且都带有开放性的坦诚探索和接纳精神。蔚蓝看重的是完整的人，而不仅仅是他们所做的工作。


  作为比较，下面总结了早期组织的反馈和绩效管理：


  #### **红色组织**


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，绩效管理是通过行使老板的个人权力。老板要求成员毫无疑问地服从命令，以保持其强硬而强大的形象。追随者为了寻求保护和安全而服从。反馈以奖惩的形式给出，目的是强化老板的权力。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  在[](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，绩效管理的目的是为了保持稳定性和施加控制。领导经常认为工人都懒惰、也不诚实，需要密切监视其工作表现，以确保命令得到妥善执行。顺从者得到奖励。失败很快就会被指出。屡犯者有被小组/组织拒绝的风险，并严重丢面子。


  #### **Orange organizations**


  ![](/media/performance.jpg)


  在[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，绩效管理的重点是实现目的和目标。每个人都要根据管理层设定的“努力延伸”目标来衡量（并评级）自己的表现。高度重视创新和可定量评估的成功结果。反馈是一个自上而下的过程，关注工作绩效，目的是鼓励人们取得更大的成果。


  #### **绿色组织**


  在[Green organizations](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/), 中，绩效管理关注的是如何开展工作，而不是取得什么成果。与激励目标相关联的强大价值观，支撑着成员能自觉管理自己的绩效。管理者成为仆人式的领导，并努力去帮助并授权给那些在第一线工作的成员。反馈通常通过一种叫做[360度反馈](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback)的流程来进行，目的是同时培养并支持个人发展和组织文化。performance management is as much concerned about how work is carried out as it is about what is achieved. Strong values linked to an inspirational purpose provide guidance to help employees manage their own performance. Managers become servant leaders and seek to enable and empower those who are doing the front line work. Feedback occurs often through a [360 degree feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback) process and is designed to nurture and support both individuals in their development and the culture of the organization

  #### **Performance management**


  In a traditional [Orange organization](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/), performance is monitored through the deployment of a top-down performance management system ensuring the alignment of set individual objectives with strategic business targets. In this highly documented process managers and employees agree on objectives to be achieved. Hierarchy is fully responsible for meeting assigned business targets. Pressure is therefore put on employees to ensure targets are achieved and ideally exceeded through individual contribution.


  Such a formal top-down performance tracking system does not exist in [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/). In a self-managed Teal organization where there are no bosses, the drive to deliver results comes from intrinsic motivation. Teal organizations hold that people are motivated when their work has a meaningful [purpose](../listening-to-purpose/), when they are subject to healthy peer pressure and when they have access to accurate feedback from the outside world. They believe that people tend to become more deeply engaged, and achieve far more than is asked for, when they are doing worthwhile work with full responsibility and ready access to needed resources.


  Although people do not need management pressure to perform, they still need to know how they are doing. For this purpose feedback is extensively used in Teal organizations with a primary focus on team performance.


  #### **Feedback**


  In many organizations, the feedback process frequently fails because it comes from a place of fear, judgement and separation. Feedback given from love, acceptance and connection is a nourishing experience that allows people to gauge where they are and to work out collaboratively what they need to do next. Efficient feedback facilitates growth and enables people to align what the organization needs with what energizes them.


  Even with open, healthy relationships, providing feedback when things don’t go as expected can be a challenge for some. Providing timely feedback about missed expectations or tensions is a key Teal practice to be embraced regardless of discomfort. [Teal organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)are high on trust and low on fear. Being able to give effective feedback in this environment is a vital skill. Employees are often trained to use approaches such as [Nonviolent Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) so that they can be mindful about their intentions and their practice when giving feedback. 


  #### **Team performance management**


  Self-managed teams are the vital organs of a [Teal organization](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/). When people have a clear understanding of the purpose of their work and know what is expected, teams are more than capable of setting goals and organizing to achieve them. To support this way of working, information is openly shared about the performance of each team. This would be threatening in a more traditional organization, but is liberating in a Teal organization because people know that the information will not be used against them. No one needs to be protected from the facts, good or bad.


  When teams are delivering similar work, as they do in [Buurtzorg](https://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/) for instance, a team can easily assess their productivity compared to that of the other teams. Those at the bottom of the list are motivated by pride rather than fear to improve. More significantly, the other teams are ready and willing to share what they do and provide any help required. The work of the organization is more important than any ego driven competition between the teams.


  When teams don’t do comparable work, some organizations have developed a different process. At [Morning Star](https://www.morningstarco.com/) for example, teams prepare a presentation for their colleagues every year where they candidly share what went well, what didn’t, how efficient they were and what they plan to do in the year ahead. Teams that haven’t performed well are challenged and supported in equal measure. In the process they receive helpful feedback and input to help them make the necessary improvements.


  #### **Individual performance management**


  People are relational beings that thrive on honest feedback. Although the primary focus is on team performance, [Teal organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)recognize that being able to give open, non-judgmental individual feedback to peers is vital. Some organisations such as [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) have stopped having formal appraisal discussions because feedback is exchanged so freely. Most others still see value in having a formal period once a year to reflect on their work. These appraisals are naturally built around peer-based processes.


  Peer-based feedback has the advantage of providing each individual with a broader, more meaningful perspective on their contribution. Feedback goes beyond the confines of a narrow discussion about the job and brings in a wider exploration of the person’s hopes, fears and sense of purpose in life.
faq:
  - question: What happens if someone is performing poorly?
    answer: This would normally be addressed using the feedback process, or if there
      are major disagreements, the [conflict resolution
      process](../conflict-resolution/). It is important to note that, while
      feedback is most effective when delivered from a perspective of love and
      support, all peers have the obligation to not shy away from difficult
      conversations and to hold each other accountable. Frequently, poor
      performance is effectively addressed by finding a better fit between an
      individual's role(s) and his/her strengths. Understanding what has led to
      poor performance from a whole person perspective is essential if a
      workable solution is to be found.
  - question: How does this link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      The three Teal breakthroughs are all directly connected with the way
      feedback is given and performance is managed. Individuals and teams are
      guided and motivated by the [evolutionary purpose
      ](../evolutionary-purpose/)of the organization. This allows
      [self-management](../self-management/) rather than top-down management.
      Feedback given from a place of compassion and care recognizing the
      [wholeness ](../wholeness/)of people, facilitates open inquiry and
      discussion, which in turn stimulates higher levels of performance.


      #### **Self-management**


      In Teal Organizations, performance management is largely a self-directed process. Individuals and teams take responsibility for their own performance and growth, while soliciting feedback from others when relevant.


      #### **Wholeness**


      The goal of traditional performance management is an objective assessment of how well someone does their job. This assessment is subject to rating errors and biases. This subjective element often generates fear and/or frustration. Under these conditions people tend to disengage.


      Giving feedback in a [Teal organization](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)  is an opportunity to recognize the whole person (including their hopes, fears and aspirations). Feedback has the sole aim of helping each other, peer-to-peer. Giving feedback from a position of love, acceptance and connection allows people to lower their defenses and engage with each other openly and honestly. Not surprisingly, when people feel valued for who they are, they are more receptive to constructive feedback and contribute far more to their work. In a Teal organization performance management changes from managing someone’s performance to creating the conditions where someone can perform.


      #### **Evolutionary purpose**


      Having a strong sense of evolutionary purpose allows people to align their efforts with the purpose of the organization and thus to manage their own performance. They contribute because they **want** to, not because they **have** to. When the [purpose ](../listening-to-purpose/)is clear and meaningful, feedback can easily be given about how well a contribution or a decision aligns with the direction of the organization. Performance management becomes "How can we respond to what is happening?" rather than "How well am I performing against the plan?". Having a meaningful evolutionary purpose guides what action is taken next.
