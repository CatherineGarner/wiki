  本主题探讨蔚蓝组织如何处理反馈和绩效管理。

perspective: >-
  蔚蓝组织固有的透明度，意味着组织的所有成员都能时刻不断地接受反馈。这包括隐含和明确的反馈。隐含反馈指的是，个人能自由获取关于组织整体状态的信息。明确反馈是指，同事之间公开分享他们对其他成员和团队的想法和感受。

  在蔚蓝组织中，成员对努力实现组织[进化目标](../evolutionary-purpose/)的承诺，时刻内在地激励着成员努力工作。绩效主要在团队层面进行，通过同事反馈和效仿竞争来管理。信息和结果都被公开共享，人们能得到信任，所以有权了解组织和其他团队的表现情况。提供反馈是所有人共同的责任，对团队和个人层面的反馈会自动频繁的发生。在蔚蓝组织中，反馈的作用尤其有用，因为这类反馈不带有评判能量，并且都带有开放性的坦诚探索和接纳精神。蔚蓝看重的是完整的人，而不仅仅是他们所做的工作。


  作为比较，下面总结了早期组织的反馈和绩效管理：


  #### **红色组织**


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，绩效管理是通过行使老板的个人权力。老板要求成员毫无疑问地服从命令，以保持其强硬而强大的形象。追随者为了寻求保护和安全而服从。反馈以奖惩的形式给出，目的是强化老板的权力。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  在[](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，绩效管理的目的是为了保持稳定性和施加控制。领导经常认为工人都懒惰、也不诚实，需要密切监视其工作表现，以确保命令得到妥善执行。顺从者得到奖励。失败很快就会被指出。屡犯者有被小组/组织拒绝的风险，并严重丢面子。


  #### **Orange organizations**


  ![](/media/performance.jpg)


  在[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，绩效管理的重点是实现目的和目标。每个人都要根据管理层设定的“努力延伸”目标来衡量（并评级）自己的表现。高度重视创新和可定量评估的成功结果。反馈是一个自上而下的过程，关注工作绩效，目的是鼓励人们取得更大的成果。


  #### **绿色组织**


  在[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，绩效管理关注的是如何开展工作，而不是取得什么成果。与激励目标相关联的强大价值观，支撑着成员能自觉管理自己的绩效。管理者成为仆人式的领导，并努力去帮助并授权给那些在第一线工作的成员。反馈通常通过一种叫做[360度反馈](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback)的流程来进行，目的是同时培养并支持个人发展和组织文化。

  #### **绩效管理**


  在传统的[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，通常通过部署自上而下的绩效管理系统来监控绩效，以确保所设定的个人目标与组织的战略业务目标相一致。在这个高度文档化的过程中，经理和成员针对需要实现的目标达成一致。层次结构指令体系对实现指定的业务目标负全责。因此，为了确保通过个人贡献实现目标，并最好超越目标，通常会对成员施加压力。


  在[T蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，不存在这种正式的自上而下的绩效跟踪体系。在一个不存在上司的自我管理式蔚蓝组织中，按期交付成果的动力来自于成员的内在动机。蔚蓝组织认为，当人们的工作具有意义深远的[目标](../listening-to-purpose/)时，当他们受到来自同伴的健康的类比压力时，当他们能够获得来自外部世界的准确反馈时，就能得到激励。蔚蓝认为，当人们对工作有充分的责任感，并在随时可以获得所需资源的前提下、从事有价值的工作时，往往会变得更加投入，并取得远远超过要求的成就。


  尽管人们不再需要管理压力来督促任务的执行，但仍然需要知道自己的表现状态如何。为此，在蔚蓝组织中得到广泛应用的是，主要聚焦于团队层面的绩效反馈。


  #### **反馈**


  在许多传统组织中，反馈过程经常会失败，因为内容都来自一个恐惧、批评和分离的层面。基于爱、接纳和连带感中得到的反馈，却是一种很健康的体验，能让人们客观判断自己或团队现在处于何处，并能通过协作共同确定下一步需要做什么。有效的反馈有助于组织的发展，并能让成员将组织的需求和自己内在动力结合一体。


  即使在开放性、健康的同事关系中，要做到当事情不能按预期进行时及时提供反馈，对某些人来说依然是个挑战。及时提供关于某个未达成的预期效果，或某个紧张关系的反馈，在蔚蓝实践中至关重要，无论多么不舒服也要驯服人性去做。[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)are high on trust and low on fear. Being able to give effective feedback in this environment is a vital skill. Employees are often trained to use approaches such as [Nonviolent Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) so that they can be mindful about their intentions and their practice when giving feedback. 


  #### **Team performance management**


  Self-managed teams are the vital organs of a [Teal organization](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/). When people have a clear understanding of the purpose of their work and know what is expected, teams are more than capable of setting goals and organizing to achieve them. To support this way of working, information is openly shared about the performance of each team. This would be threatening in a more traditional organization, but is liberating in a Teal organization because people know that the information will not be used against them. No one needs to be protected from the facts, good or bad.


  When teams are delivering similar work, as they do in [Buurtzorg](https://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/) for instance, a team can easily assess their productivity compared to that of the other teams. Those at the bottom of the list are motivated by pride rather than fear to improve. More significantly, the other teams are ready and willing to share what they do and provide any help required. The work of the organization is more important than any ego driven competition between the teams.


  When teams don’t do comparable work, some organizations have developed a different process. At [Morning Star](https://www.morningstarco.com/) for example, teams prepare a presentation for their colleagues every year where they candidly share what went well, what didn’t, how efficient they were and what they plan to do in the year ahead. Teams that haven’t performed well are challenged and supported in equal measure. In the process they receive helpful feedback and input to help them make the necessary improvements.


  #### **Individual performance management**


  People are relational beings that thrive on honest feedback. Although the primary focus is on team performance, [Teal organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)recognize that being able to give open, non-judgmental individual feedback to peers is vital. Some organisations such as [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) have stopped having formal appraisal discussions because feedback is exchanged so freely. Most others still see value in having a formal period once a year to reflect on their work. These appraisals are naturally built around peer-based processes.


  Peer-based feedback has the advantage of providing each individual with a broader, more meaningful perspective on their contribution. Feedback goes beyond the confines of a narrow discussion about the job and brings in a wider exploration of the person’s hopes, fears and sense of purpose in life.
faq:
  - question: What happens if someone is performing poorly?
    answer: This would normally be addressed using the feedback process, or if there
      are major disagreements, the [conflict resolution
      process](../conflict-resolution/). It is important to note that, while
      feedback is most effective when delivered from a perspective of love and
      support, all peers have the obligation to not shy away from difficult
      conversations and to hold each other accountable. Frequently, poor
      performance is effectively addressed by finding a better fit between an
      individual's role(s) and his/her strengths. Understanding what has led to
      poor performance from a whole person perspective is essential if a
      workable solution is to be found.
  - question: How does this link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      The three Teal breakthroughs are all directly connected with the way
      feedback is given and performance is managed. Individuals and teams are
      guided and motivated by the [evolutionary purpose
      ](../evolutionary-purpose/)of the organization. This allows
      [self-management](../self-management/) rather than top-down management.
      Feedback given from a place of compassion and care recognizing the
      [wholeness ](../wholeness/)of people, facilitates open inquiry and
      discussion, which in turn stimulates higher levels of performance.


      #### **Self-management**


      In Teal Organizations, performance management is largely a self-directed process. Individuals and teams take responsibility for their own performance and growth, while soliciting feedback from others when relevant.


      #### **Wholeness**


      The goal of traditional performance management is an objective assessment of how well someone does their job. This assessment is subject to rating errors and biases. This subjective element often generates fear and/or frustration. Under these conditions people tend to disengage.


      Giving feedback in a [Teal organization](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)  is an opportunity to recognize the whole person (including their hopes, fears and aspirations). Feedback has the sole aim of helping each other, peer-to-peer. Giving feedback from a position of love, acceptance and connection allows people to lower their defenses and engage with each other openly and honestly. Not surprisingly, when people feel valued for who they are, they are more receptive to constructive feedback and contribute far more to their work. In a Teal organization performance management changes from managing someone’s performance to creating the conditions where someone can perform.


      #### **Evolutionary purpose**


      Having a strong sense of evolutionary purpose allows people to align their efforts with the purpose of the organization and thus to manage their own performance. They contribute because they **want** to, not because they **have** to. When the [purpose ](../listening-to-purpose/)is clear and meaningful, feedback can easily be given about how well a contribution or a decision aligns with the direction of the organization. Performance management becomes "How can we respond to what is happening?" rather than "How well am I performing against the plan?". Having a meaningful evolutionary purpose guides what action is taken next.
