  本文讨论了蔚蓝组织中如何处理管理职能。

  ## 新视角


  在过去的几十年里，特别是在大型组织中，我们见证了管理职能的激增：人力资源（HR）、战略规划、法律事务、财务、内部沟通、风险管理、内部审计、投资者关系、培训、公共事务、环境控制、工程服务、质量控制，知识管理等。


  在琥珀阶段，为了支持建立和遵守组织的流程和规划，开始开发出各种管理角色。橙色阶段让这些得到进一步扩大，促进了橙色范式所追求的效率，并满足这个阶段对专门知识和问责制的渴望。虽然在绿色组织中，开始出现用管理职能角色持一线的新理念（但嘲讽的是，这反而会导致负责人力资源管理成员的增加）。只有在蔚蓝下，管理职能增加的趋势才得以扭转。在蔚蓝组织中，尽可能由一线团队自己完成那些通常由管理职能担当的任务。那些传统管理职能类成员角色，通常不再有机会将脱离实际的规则或决定，强加给组织。

  ## 实践中


  在大多数传统组织中，由集中化的管理职能部门为其他单元制定规则、政策和流程。从事这类管理职能的人，往往是出于好意，自然倾向于通过设计规则和程序、积累专门知识、发现新问题来“增加价值”，以此证明自己的价值。


  这导致将决策权从前线剥夺而集中到管理核心。前线的人往往感到权力被剥夺：他们必须遵守那些通常只在原则上有意义的纸上谈兵的规则，这些一般不能适应实践中实际面临的复杂具体情况。


  基于这些原因，蔚蓝组织将管理职能限制在最低限度。他们明白，由于管理职能而产生的规模经济和技能经济效益，往往被副作用的不经济动机所抵消。因此，在蔚蓝组织中，很少有人从事专门的管理职能。即使存在少数必要的职能人员，也都没有决策权。他们的功能是提供一些指南但无权将某个规则或决策强加给组织。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  #### 专业知识需求


  在每一个组织中，存在着一种天然的矛盾：对专业知识的需求，与让第一线人员做决定的需求。当需要专业知识时，大多数组织的第一反应就是建立一个中心专家库。当然，其风险在于随着时间的推移，组织内会出现两个族群：一群是有声望的（通常是高薪的）中央专家组，另一群是在实地完成业务工作但没有权力的人。


  蔚蓝组织规避了这个弊端，原则上以分布式方式开发专业知识。随着时间的推移，一线团队的同事能积累很多专业知识。一个机器操作员可能知道某种润滑剂的使用，一个家庭护理护士对某种神秘的医疗状况了如指掌，或者一个工程师知道如何创建一个复杂的金融工具来计算新机器的投资回报。蔚蓝组织致力于帮助团队成员自愿找到某个自己认可的，具有正确专业知识的同事去寻求知识，代之以强硬的为这些专家任命权威性职能角色来强加指导。这样一来，同事能更愿意并积极的向他们寻求建议和专业知识，极大地激发了人们的积极性。已经开发出很多能支持这类信息共享的特殊系统，例如内部社交网络和知识平台。


  在许多情况下，都可以成立志愿者[工作队](../project-teams-and-task-forces/)（通过中央知识库、培训等）编纂和传播特定领域的知识。


  还有一种方法是，某些领域的专业知识（比如人力资源部的劳动法）可以承包给外部专业机构。当一线团队成员需要时，可以利用自由职业者或顾问的咨询，而不是雇佣专家担任固定经费支撑的非生产系职能角色。


  #### 规模经济


  设置管理职能团队的一个理由，是期待它能支撑规模经济。这些经济体理论上表面上看来很容易预估，这也是将某些职能集中化成管理职能的理由。然而，这些做法其实忽略了其他实际成本，比如因此降低了基层成员的自主性和动力，或与一线现实情况脱节而带来的负面效果。


  蔚蓝组织不通过建立传统意义上的管理职能来追求规模经济。比如说，一个工厂或多个工厂的不同团队都购买某种材料，将他们的采购集中起来很有意义。其中一个团队可能会直接成为该产品的首席采购员（比如通过定期向其他团队索要订单）。通过这种方式，不同的团队以分散的方式为其他团队牵引某些工作。


  In other cases, it might make sense for colleagues to create a role to handle certain functions. For instance, in certain countries, labor laws might imply a lot of administrative work to manage payroll. Teams could decide to delegate this work to a central staff role that they created. In Teal however, the central staff role works on behalf of the teams, and cannot impose top-down decisions. A frontline team that decides not to use the services of the central support staff is free to do so.


  #### Setting standards


  Similarly, in many cases, it makes sense to set common standards for the entire organization, for instance in human resources (e.g., let's make sure everyone gets the same experience, whatever team they are hired into), marketing (e.g., let's use common templates and design elements), finance (e.g., let's make numbers comparable), IT (e.g., let's buy equipment that is compatible), etc. In traditional organizations, rules, policies and procedures are set up by central staff functions, who then also enforce compliance.


  In Teal, such standards can easily be decided upon by one person taking the lead, using the advice process. Alternatively, people with similar roles in different units (say people involved with on-boarding new colleagues) can create a voluntary task force and jointly devise standards and guidelines. AES, a large energy provider, when it operated on self-managing principles, worked with an 80/20 rule: all colleagues were expected to spend 20% of their time in a voluntary task force (or temporary project team) next to the 80% on their primary roles.

  - question: What about highly regulated businesses?
    answer: >-
      In some industries, the risks for non-compliance with certain procedures
      are especially high. Regulators might even go so far as to require someone
      to sign on behalf of the organization, typically a “C-Suite” executive
      ―the CFO for the accounts, the Chief Risk Officer for topics related to
      risk, etc. Because this individual risks personal consequences for the
      organization’s non-compliance including legal actions imposed by outside
      regulators, he or she would naturally want to protect him or herself from
      risk by mandating strict rules and enforcing their compliance. How can
      self-managing organizations address this issue?


      One way to deal with this is through voluntary task forces. A risk task force for instance, composed of people with roles related to risk in their respective units, could commonly decide on standards and policies to ensure risks are mitigated in ways that align with the regulator's request. In terms of who then signs on behalf of the organization (or interfaces with the regulator), members of the task force might take turns with each member taking on that responsibility for a one-year period. The task force can also decide to organize cross-audits where a member of one unit audits another unit. Organizations like AES who have used this method report that there is more, not less, control. Voluntary task forces know much better than a central staff function far away in headquarters where the risks are, what guidelines are appropriate, where and what to look for in cross-audits. And voluntary task forces breed a sense of solidarity and responsibility. If one unit fails, it will be "one of us" who has to bear the brunt of repercussions from the regulator. Compare this to traditional staff roles, where the Head of Risk in headquarters edicts rules that are often hard to apply on the ground, enticing people to find workarounds.


      The case of [AES ](http://www.aes.com/)(see more on AES below) which has operated in the highly regulated electricity generation and distribution markets, gives at least an indication that the existence of strong regulation can be dealt with by self-managing structures.
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      #### Self-management


      Central staff functions, as they are used today in many large organizations, concentrate power away from their operational colleagues. Eliminating or drastically reducing the influence of centralized staff returns autonomy to the rest of the organization and is a key element of the Teal breakthrough of self-management.


      #### Wholeness


      In many organizations, the relationship of central staff functions with people in operating units is based on mistrust: without staff policing them, operations cannot be relied on to act in ways that benefit the organization as a whole. With Teal, people are trusted to take into account the needs of the whole organization and are freed to pursue their passions and interests.


      #### Evolutionary purpose


      Central staff functions tend to make the organization more static and prevent innovations from happening freely at the margins, thereby slowing down the unfolding of the organization's purpose. Dealing in decentralized ways with the need for expertise, economies of scale and joint standards increases an organization's agility, and thereby its potential to pursue its evolutionary purpose.
