  此文回顾了董事会的作用以及蔚蓝模式下董事会的一些做法和工作方式。
perspective: >-
  ## 新视角


  弗雷德里克·拉鲁说，蔚蓝组织中董事会的组成至关重要。他警告说，当采用蔚蓝方法时，“唯一的成败因素是最高领导层和公司所有者/董事会的世界观。”^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 238]


  为什么会这样？蔚蓝组织尝试的历史经验证明，当事情进展顺利时，董事会可能会支持蔚蓝做法。但是通常董事会由那些、以前可能没有在类似环境中工作过的外部人士组成。于是在不顺利（压力发生）时，董事会对蔚蓝的支持会很快消失。但是在我们目前的法律架构下，董事会仍然拥有最终的权力。（如果搞了一些传统僵化的投资人进董事会就没救了。）


  董事会在早期组织中的作用表现为：


  #### 红色组织


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，虽然主管/老板可能会信任一些亲信同事或家人，但真正的权力由老板一个人行使。在这种情况下，“监督职能的董事会”既不受欢迎，也不合适。


  #### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，典型的董事会是位于僵化等级制度顶端的小社会阶层。可能存在正式的入选标准或资格审查程序。董事会扮演“监护人”的角色：它确保传统、规则和程序得到尊重。


  #### 橙色组织


  在[橙色模式](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)董事会的存在是为了让管理层代表股东/所有者，或在非盈利的情况下代表出资人负责任。董事会的重点是目标、结果、战略、控制和继任。并负责任免首席执行官。


  #### 绿色组织


  在[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，董事会的职责与橙色类似，但还可能包括扩展职责：作为组织目标/价值观，以及多个利益相关者利益的守护者。在绿色营利组织中，董事（股东）通常被视为利益相关者群体中的一员，可以特别指定某个代表其他利益相关者，比如成员利益的董事会成员。

  ## 实践中


  ### 董事会需要接纳蔚蓝思维


  这意味着：


  * 放弃传统观点中的命令和控制特权

  * 与成员一起“倾听”组织的发展目标，并愿意遵循其方向。

  * 接受组织的目标和价值观。

  * 或“保持距离”或尽一切可能支持组织的蔚蓝模式实践。

  #### The board should also adopt Teal practices

    In self-managing organizations, the board is part of the "advice process". For example, if a board member believes a decision is needed, she should seek advice from appropriate people throughout the organization. In so doing, she not only shows support for the practice, but also invites others to seek advice from the board. This means the division between the board and the rest of the company becomes more ‘porous’, reducing the need for "go-betweens".

  #### The potential for conflict


  As mentioned earlier, there is potential for conflict when board members do not have a deeply held Teal worldview, since a board generally has ultimate legal authority. Even for board members with a Teal worldview, there is potential for problems in for-profit organizations. This is because board members there have a fiduciary duty to shareholders, and there is at least the potential that Teal practices may not always be viewed as serving those fiduciary duties.


  For–profit Teal organizations can pursue a couple of avenues to limit this potential for conflict. First, they can work to transition (with appropriate shareholder consent) the company to a “Benefit Corporation” structure. This structure, adopted in many states in the U.S., extends the duty of directors to include non-financial interests such as social benefit, concerns of employees and suppliers and environmental impact.


  Second, Holacracy has drafted a constitution that a board can adopt and make binding, even to future shareholders. It gives shareholders a legitimate say in matters related to finance, but prevents them from unilaterally imposing a strategy, or from reverting the organization to traditional management practices.


  Ultimately, the board is a construct of prior organizational stages, and it is as yet unclear exactly what its role should be under Teal or even if in its current form it is fully compatible with Teal.
faq:
  - question: If the organization is self-managing, why have a board?
    answer: >-
      1. A board might be a legal requirement, but more importantly it can act
      as a "spaceholder" and protector of Teal practices. This obviously
      necessitates that board members share the [fundamental
      assumptions](../fundamental-assumptions/) and the [values
      ](../culture-and-values/)underpinning Teal.

      2. It can add perspective, diversity and expertise on important decisions via the advice process.

      3. It can facilitate the process of appointing a new "CEO", should the organization have a continuing need for such a role, when a transition is due.


      Having said this, at Morningstar, Chris Rufer, founder and 100% owner, sees no need for a board. People at Morningstar regard the company’s mission/purpose as their ultimate boss.
  - question: Who will decide whether the CEO needs to go?
    answer: >-
      The [conflict resolution ](../conflict-resolution/)process deals with this
      and can be started by anyone who feels that a role-holder (including that
      of CEO) should be changed. Note that In a Teal company, the "CEO" role may
      be different. The "CEO" is an employee with the same rights and duties as
      anybody else.


      At Favi, when Zobrist became CEO, he promised his position would be submitted to a vote every 5 years.


      At Buurtzorg, the board does not appoint the CEO. This comes from within the organization itself.
  - question: Who should be part of the board?
    answer: >-
      Suitable people who:


      * Understand the core purpose of the organization; 


      * Are committed to its endeavours;


      * Share its guiding beliefs;


      * Can help connect the organization and develop relationships with its external environment.
