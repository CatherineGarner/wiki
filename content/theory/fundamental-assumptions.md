  本页介绍一些根深蒂固的，潜藏在组织模式和实践根源部位的，通常是无意识的（关于人性及其动机、人在世界和职场中的角色、生命的意义等的）基本假设。

perspective: >-
  人类组织在每一个历史阶段，都产生了特有的基本假设、对人及其动机的不同看法，以及与世界互动时截然不同的方法。


  #### 红色组织


  从[红色视角](../red-organizations/)出发的基本假设是:


  * 可以掠夺世界上的无尽资源而据为己用。也可以掠夺组织/部落以外的人。

  * 世界是个充满敌意的地方。“你死我活”。征服到的领土必须通过（不断的）斗争和警惕来保卫。如果一个人不能对环境做出迅速反应，就会失去一切。

  * 社会结构是基于***权力和尊重***。种群中划分阶级、存在着自然的进食顺序，只保证“卓越个体”的生存和繁荣。为了生存，一个人要去控制才能占优势，否则就要顺从他人而寻求庇护。

  * 人只能相信自己，或在某种程度上相信那些“宣誓效忠”的人。保持警惕是必要的，因为人们的忠诚会在一夜之间改变。

  * 唯一规则是酋长行使权力，此外无其他固定的规则。对错由老大决定。老大之外的成员不需要思考。

  * 自私是可接受的行为（甚至是被鼓励的）。个人可以享用自己力量范围能获得的一切（剥削和占有）– 只要没有被更强者捕获或击败就行。没有罪恶感，只有权力或顺从。不关心其他人的想法和感受。

  * 不属于“核心圈”的人注定被剥削和利用。不求被人爱戴，只求被人恐惧。


  （领导风格：掠夺性，比喻：狼群）


  #### 琥珀组织


  从[A琥珀视角](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)出发的基本假设是:


  * 世界是（或应该是）不变的、可理解的和可控的。过去有用的东西将来也会有用。***稳定（安全）和忠诚***是必不可少的。人们对变化持怀疑态度。除非万不得已不会离开公司。

  * 事情非对即错。需要一套必须遵守的组织权威：规则、程序等。个人意见与此无关。人在犯错误时自然感到内疚。

  * 要遵循社会强加于你的规则和期望，即使这意味着要戴上伪善道德的社会面具。鼓励自我控制和压抑。

  * 人的本性基本上是懒惰、不诚实、不聪明、需要指导。人们必须受到监督，并时刻提醒他们需要做什么。因此需要有明确的指挥链条、形式化的流程以及明晰定义的规则，用来规定谁可以做什么。

  * 每个人都有可替代性，随时都能被另一个在流程中扮演相同角色的人取代。不需要创新性、批判性思维和自我表达。信息共享的规则是，只告知该阶层需要知道的最小限度信息。

  * 成功意味着以完美的方式履行自己在组织中的角色（“你就是你的工作，你在社会中的地位从出生起，就基本上被明确注定了。”）

  * (领导风格：专制-家长式。比喻：军队。)


  #### 橙色组织


  从 [橙色视角](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/) 出发的基本假设是:


  * 这个世界充满了各种可能性和挑战，在等待我们去发现和解决。如果一个人足够聪明，工作足够努力，就可以获得身居高位的所有待遇。如果做不到，那是他自己的错。

  * **实质性的结果和地位**至关重要（名利）。财务底线最重要：衡量成功的真正（唯一）标准是金钱和物质财富。这些才是人们最终的动力。

  * 有用即真理。实用主义比权威更有价值。理性高于一切。情绪、怀疑、梦想、意义和目标等话题不属于职场。这些人性表达会分散我们实现目标的注意力。做个职业人士，意味着隐藏私生活。

  * 被社会接受非常重要，因为人要靠别人才能实现自己的目标，评估自己的成功。人必须戴上有助于成功与控制的职业面具

  * 只有领域里的精英，才能并且应该登上塔顶。竞争无处不在，应该鼓励竞争。为了生存和繁荣，人必须智胜他人，在竞争中取胜。

  * 创新是经济增长的必要条件。变化是唯一不变的东西。没有时间和空间去容忍错误和弱点。

  * 具有明确的目标很重要。幸福感的前提是实现下一个外部目标（获得下一次晋升、找到生活伴侣、购买新车……）。

  * 如果让成员完全的自我管理，一定不会有好结果。虽然成员有一定的自由度来决定如何完成自己工作，但基本上都需要方向性指导。人们需要得到外在的奖励和竞争的激励，才能在巅峰时期做出出色表现。管理层要负责为部下设定明确的目标、激励计划和控制。管理层必须控制局面。

  * (领导风格：职业专家/成功者，“解决问题、战略性、结果导向型”。比喻：机器。)


  #### 绿色组织


  从 [绿色视角](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/) 出发的基本假设是:


  * 拜金主义、社会不平等和社区感丧失都是不理想的。关系比结果更重要。最重要的是**归属感与和谐**。

  * 人之初性本善。每个人的观点和意见都是有价值的。冲突或竞争不是自然界唯一的规律，协作也是我们的基因。共同的价值观比严格的规则和政策更有效。

  * 每个人都有天赋。多样性能带来更好的结果。要不惜一切代价避免冲突。采用自下而上的流程汲取决策信息，决策方法是并达成共识（民主）。

  * 人们必须能在工作中成长并充分发挥天赋潜力。管理层（HR）应创造必要的条件。这意味着要给讨论、学习和犯错误留下很大的空间。激励人们的团队协作精神。领导为被领导者服务。

  * 人人平等。认为人是分离的，社会上的许多力量把我们分开或陷入不平等，因此为了实现人与人之间的深度交流，就必须去努力。除了股东之外，还存在着多方其他的利益相关者。他们应该得到同等的关注。大自然、局部社区和整个社会都应被视为广义的利益相关者。

  * (领导风格：催化/协同创新，“团队导向、协作、服务型领导”。比喻：家庭。)


  #### Teal Organizations


  Fundamental assumptions from a Teal perspective are:


  * Human beings and organizations as living systems are full of potential waiting to unfold. Building on strengths is more important than focusing on weaknesses.

  * One can ***trust*** ***the abundance of life.*** People and organizations who share the same life serving goals are allies rather than competitors.

  * All of life is intrinsically interconnected. As humans and individuals, we share a place in the grand scheme of life. Having equal human value is self-evident, and does not require struggle or sameness in form or expression.

  * The goal of life is ***becoming the truest expression of oneself***, to honor one's birthright and callings, and to be of service to humanity and the world. Your contribution is developing your own unique strengths and expressions, and then leading life's joy through that into this world, thereby playing your tune in the symphony of life.

  * One is not one's Ego. "Don’t let the need to look good, to be successful, to fit in,… run your life."

  * If one keeps the channel open, one can listen into the life that wants to be lived through oneself – or the purpose that wants to be served by the organization. Life does not need to be coerced. All we have to do is tune into what life wants to express or create and life will provide for itself what is needed. Sense and respond, rather than plan and control.

  * Even if something unexpected or mistakes happen, things will turn out all right. If they don’t, life is offering an opportunity to learn and grow. Let go of fear.

  * A good decision is a decision that is in line with one's inner compass – it is not only based on facts and figures, but includes emotions and intuition.

  * (Leadership style: co-creative/synergistic, "deeply empathetic, systemic, holding space for the purpose". Metaphor: Living System / Living Organism).
inPractice: >-
  Many of us hold deeply ingrained assumptions about people and work that are
  based on fear, assumptions that call for hierarchy and control. Teal
  organizations articulate the assumptions they hold about people and about
  work. Only by shining light on these fear-based beliefs can we decide to
  choose a different set of assumptions. When colleagues talk about the two sets
  of assumptions and are reminded of them frequently, they start to shift their
  belief system.


  #### Checking with the fundamental assumptions in daily processes


  Colleagues in Teal organizations routinely check the way daily practices ([meetings](../meetings/), [conflict resolution](../conflict-resolution/), [team / community building](../team-and-community-building/), [decision making](../decision-making/)) are conducted – and the outcomes they generate with the [values ](../culture-and-values/)and underlying fundamental assumptions.  


  #### Articulating both sets of assumptions when transforming an existing organization


  Most of the organizational practices chosen will be deeply counter-cultural to more conventional organizations. It is possible that people will question choices and call new assumptions foolish. Debates can be more fruitful when they don't stay at the level of arguing for or against a certain management practice, but when they take place at a deeper level, discussing the often hidden assumptions underneath the practice.


  For example, each time when [AES](http://www.aes.com/) acquired a new power plant, the CEO would introduce AES's management practices to the new group of colleagues by asking them what assumptions owners and managers of a typical factory hold of their workers (see further: In Practice).


  #### Practical tips:


  1. Start by uncovering the unspoken assumptions behind the traditional hierarchical organizational (Amber/Orange) model.

  2. Don't do it alone - explore it together with your team.


  #### Discussing the fundamental assumptions when starting up a teal organization


  When starting up a Teal organization, choosing the right co-founders is a critical decision. If the organization is to run on Evolutionary-Teal principles, the founders' readiness to embrace Teal ways of operating are crucial. Be ready to spend a significant amount of time discussing these topics - including the fundamental assumptions on people and work. You are shaping the culture of your organization before it has even started.  


  #### Self-management


  To operate effectively – even at a large scale – with a system based on peer relationships, without the need for either hierarchy nor consensus, one relies on the following Teal principles. They in turn are based on the fundamental assumptions of Teal:


  ##### *Trust*


  * We relate to one another with an assumption of positive intent.

  * Until we are proven wrong, trusting co-workers is our default means of engagement.

  * Freedom and accountability are two sides of the same coin.


  ##### *Information and decision making*


  * All business information is open to all.

  * Every one of us is able to handle difficult and sensitive news.

  * We believe in the power of collective intelligence. Nobody is as smart as everybody. Therefore all decisions will be made with the "[advice process](../decision-making/)".


  ##### *Responsibility and accountability*


  * We each have full responsibility for the organization. If we sense that something needs to happen, we have a duty to address it. it's not acceptable to limit our concern to the remit of roles.

  * Everyone must be comfortable with holding others accountable to their commitments through feedback and respectful confrontation.


  #### Wholeness


  To bring your whole self to work, to be able to be whole in your relationship with others and with life and nature, you build on the following assumptions:


  ##### *Equal worth*


  * We are all of fundamental equal worth.

  * At the same time, our community will be richest if we let all members contribute in their distinctive way. We appreciate the differences in roles, education, backgrounds, interests, skills, characters and points of view.


  ##### *Safe and caring workplace*


  * Any situation can be approached from fear and separation or from love and connection. We choose love and connection.

  * We strive to create emotionally and spiritually safe environments, where each of us can behave authentically.

  * We honor the moods of love, care, appreciation, recognition, gratitude, curiosity, fun, playfulness…

  * We are comfortable with vocabulary like care, love, service, purpose, soul,... in the workplace.


  ##### *Overcoming separation*


  * We aim to have a workplace where we can honor all parts of us: the cognitive, the physical, emotional and spiritual; the rational and the intuitive, the feminine and the masculine.

  * We recognize that we are all deeply interconnected, part of something bigger and that includes nature and all forms of life.


  ##### *Learning*


  * Every problem is an invitation to learn and grow. We will always be learners. We have never arrived.

  * Failure is always a possibility, if we strive boldly for our purpose. We discuss failures openly and learn from them. Hiding or neglecting to learn from failure is not acceptable.

  * Feedback and respectful confrontation are gifts we share to help one another grow.

  * We focus on strengths more than weaknesses, on opportunities more than problems.


  ##### *Relationships and conflict*


  * It's impossible to change other people. We can only change ourselves.

  * Every person has life lessons they are meant to learn by themselves. What we can do is be there to support each other in that process of personal change.

  * We take ownership for our thoughts, beliefs, words and actions.

  * We don't spread rumors. We don't talk behind someone's back.

  * We resolve disagreements one-on-one and don't drag other people into the problem.

  * We don't blame problems on others. When we feel like blaming, we take it as an invitation to reflect on how we might be part of the problem (and the solution).


  #### Evolutionary purpose


  To see the organization as having a life of its own, with a purpose of its own, is based on trust in the abundance of life and the ability to distance yourself from your ego:


  ##### *Collective purpose*


  * We view the organization as having a soul, a creative impulse and purpose of its own.

  * We try to listen in to where the organization wants to go and beware of forcing direction onto it.


  ##### *Individual purpose*


  * We have a duty to ourselves and to the organization to inquire into our personal sense of calling to see if and how it resonates with the organization's purpose.

  * We try to imbue our roles with our souls, not our egos.


  ##### *Planning the future*


  * Trying to predict the future is futile. We make forecasts only when a specific decision requires us to do so.

  * Everything will unfold with more grace if we stop trying to control and instead choose to simply sense and respond.


  ##### *Profit*


  * In the long run, there are no trade-offs between purpose and profits. If we focus on purpose (cause), the profit (effect) will follow.
faq:
  - question: What's the difference between making explicit the fundamental
      assumptions and formulating new ones – and the traditional exercise on
      values?
    answer: "The traditional values document is often a rather disappointing
      instrument for cultural change. If there is a perceivable difference
      between theory and practice, between the official policy and experienced
      reality. A value document will most likely be irrelevant as a change
      driver. This is because the traditional exercise that produces it does not
      question the underlying fundamental assumptions which shape the structure
      and culture of the organization, and the behavior that goes with it. (It
      is like the fish not knowing the water because it is all around it.)\r

      \r\n"
  - question: Why should I bother to make these assumptions explicit?
    answer: >-
      Consider these three reasons to do so:


      1. It makes it easier to explain why you've chosen to use operating practices that defy conventional management.

      2. The assumptions can serve as touchstones for every new practice or process you consider introducing.

      3. Explicit assumptions make it easier for anybody in the organization, even the most junior colleague, to speak up and say: "I wonder if what we are doing is in line with our basic assumptions".
