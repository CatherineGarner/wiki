intro: 本文描述了在组织模式的演变进化历程中，在不同的管理范式和不同组织环境中，信息和信息流的不同运用方法。
perspective: >-
  每一个历史阶段都产生了对信息流的不同观点，以及截然不同的实践：


  ### 红色组织


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，信息和信息流由当权者控制，主要用来控制和操纵成员。信息主要通过讲故事、发布命令、威胁、贿赂和间谍活动来控制和传播。老板通常掌握着信息的所有权，并控制着沟通方式。权力用来保持追随者的依赖性和一致性。只强调信息的主观价值，信息的客观真实性往往不被重视。也就是说，如果说谎可以获得更多的好处，那么事实就没有价值或意义！在这种情况下，人们只关注能为自己的个人需求服务的信息。


  ### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/),information is more widely distributed and there is a respect for logical argument. Different viewpoints are acknowledged, but there is only room for a single truth, or set of truths. Information is controlled and communicated via the organizational hierarchy. Respect for the concept of objectivity emerges, together with competing views of the orthodox and the heretical. The truth of statements issued by those in authority may be questioned, within strict limits, but the decisions and opinions of those in authority must be respected; if not, dissenters may be punished!


  ### Orange Organizations


  In [Orange Organizations](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/), information serves primarily as a measure for “predicting and controlling”, with the credo: the more information, the better! Using measurement information, people can design a blueprint for the organization as though it was a machine. Information owned by or coming from those of higher rank in the organization is considered to be of greater value.


  ### Green Organizations


  In [Green Organizations](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/), information serves as a currency for cultural value, with the purpose of inspiring members of the organization. Information flow through the system is founded on “open book” management, with inputs from all stakeholders being given equal consideration. The information content of the "open books" is still defined by "rulers" in a hierarchical structure, but those in positions of authority focus on listening to, encouraging and motivating their teams. With “family” as the guiding metaphor in Green organizations, stories are shared and everyone can ‘sing around the campfire’.


  ### Teal Organizations


  In [Teal Organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/), information is made available to everyone equally, on an “as-is” basis. There are no secrets, and information flows where it is needed without boundaries; this is one of the fundamental prerequisites for [self-management](../self-management/) of organizations. Members of Teal organizations still respect a distinction between the sharing of information which belongs in the organizational context, and the confidential sharing of personal information; grey areas are handled with sensitivity and integrity. The dubious value of “hearsay” (second-hand reports of unrecorded verbal communication) is clearly understood.

  ### Share All Information!


  *"If you empower people but don´t give them information, they just fumble in the dark."* (Blair Vernon)


  Self-managing teams need to have all available information to make optimum [decisions ](../decision-making/)on a strategic and day-to-day basis. This means that all members of the organization must have access to all data related to the financing and operations of the organization, including salaries and performance of individuals and teams. Freely sharing information helps to build and maintain trust within the organization, and reduces the likelihood that informal hierarchies will re-emerge.


  In Teal organizations, there is a culture of trust, not fear: freely sharing information does not harm anybody, and there is no need to protect sources of information through anonymity or disguise. People are trusted to handle information with integrity, and to deal with both the positive and the negative implications of all the information available to them. In this way, people have a clear of view the information that affects them and others within the organization, and no-one develops a false sense of anxiety or security.


  When information is analyzed, contextualized and interpreted, this is not seen as a way of establishing the truth, but as a way of making the information more valuable. Valuable information flows naturally to the places where it helps to solve problems, meet challenges, drive innovation. Simply: information can now circulate freely and serve its purpose.


  #### *Discuss and Debate! Rank-free!*


  When there is new and important information to share, “all-hands” [meetings ](../meetings/)are a standard practice in Teal organizations. Quarterly results, the annual values survey, a strategic inflection point and so forth are discussed and debated in a meeting with no script or agenda of control. This is much more than simple information exchange: instead of “predict and control”, the guiding principle of information flow is “sense and response”. If information is being shared in a way which does not serve the purpose of the organization, this can be debated openly and changes made as needed.
faq:
  - question: What are good daily practices for sharing information?
    answer: All-hands meetings, stand-up meetings, open intranets, discussion
      forums, open task or work logs, blogs, open webinars.
  - question: What indicates that information flow is "stuck"?
    answer: Quiet meetings, culture of fear and blame, complex hierarchical
      decision-making processes, frequent rumours, compulsory employee surveys.
