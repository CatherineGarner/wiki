intro: 此文讨论招聘主题，介绍征聘外部候选人进入组织的具体流程，包括谁负责招聘人员以及具体面试流程的做法。

  ## 新视角


  在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations)中，招聘由需要新成员的一线团队主导。与应聘者的沟通往往围绕三个主题展开：角色适配性、组织适配性、目标适配性。通常最重视最后两个，因为在自我管理组织中，职位角色流动性很大。通常安排一段试用期间，以便双方都能据此诚实的评估这个适配是否合适。


  人类组织的每个历史阶段都产生了不同的招聘视角和截然不同的做法。


  #### **红色组织**


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，忠诚是关键。酋长选择一群人簇拥在身侧，通常是家人，可信者或服从者，既用来克服恐惧，也承诺照顾他们。招聘归结为双向选择或指派，而且在新成员加入时通常举行一个仪式，新人给出效忠老板的誓言，老板作为回报承诺为他提供保护。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  在[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，社会阶级分层是招聘的基础。应聘者要想申请工作，需要有一个特定的背景。历史上的组织中，这种等级分层与社会阶级分层一般保持同步：牧师从农民中招募；司教和主教，则来自贵族阶层。一个出生在工人阶级的男人（当然更包括女人）不会渴望得到一个管理职位，并且一旦进入组织，也不会爬得很高。如今的琥珀组织，尽管方式更微妙，但仍然倾向于遵循社会地位分层。在政府机构、学校和军队中，职位高于某一级别往往仍然需要特定的文凭或一定的经验。被录用的人可能不是能力上最合格的，但一定是符合所有硬性标准的人。


  #### **橙色组织**


  [橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)追求业绩、效率和创新，这决定了他们的招聘工作焦点是挑选最佳候选人。条件一般是，具有最佳技能、最相关经验和专门知识，能立刻发挥具体作用、具有未来发展最佳潜力。在一些大公司，面试由专门的人力资源人员（寻找公司最高领导职务时则由外部“猎头”公司）主持，大多数情况下，人力资源和此人未来的上司共同主持面试。橙色组织为了提高征聘成功率而投入大量资源和大量努力，开发了面试技术和面试方法培训，以及各种评估工具。


  #### **绿色组织**


  在[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，招聘时围绕着共享文化对候选人进行考量，与对具体技能的考量放在同等比重。管理职位候选人的心态、行为和价值观角度会受到严格的筛选：考量他们是否有授权下属的意愿和能力，是否能成为导师而不是自上而下的决策者？他们会谦逊地领导吗？注重以人为本的文化方位，将人力资源职能推到了中心位置。


  #### **蔚蓝组织**


  在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，招聘不是由人力资源（通常不存在固定的人力资源职能）负责，而是由需要新成员的团队领导负责。与应聘者的沟通往往围绕三个主题展开：角色适配性、组织适配性、目标适配性。通常更重视后两个要素，因为在自我管理组织中，职位角色流动性很大。


  Teal organizations try to be mindful of the temptation to ‘look good’ to candidates during recruitment. The premise is that both parties are trying to answer one simple, fundamental question: Do we sense that we are meant to journey together? This question can only be meaningfully answered when conversations are rooted in honesty and integrity, with a willingness to inquire deeply and openly.

  #### **Team recruitment**


  In traditional organizations, recruitment processes are regularly handled by Human Resources personnel. Their interest is to quickly fill an open position with a suitable candidate  as their performance is sometimes measured by the number of job openings that they fill. It is in their best interest to present a positive view of the company and the role in order to encourage the candidate to accept the offer. In the same way, candidates try to present themselves and their job experience in the most positive light to increase the chances that they will receive an offer of employment.


  Teal organizations try to encourage both parties to be as truthful as possible with each other. The interviews are handled by future teammates who simply want to decide if they want to work with the candidate on a daily basis. The team can take advice and counsel from HR if such a function exists, but they are in charge of the process and decision. Having 10 to 12 conversations is not unusual to provide time for both parties to feel each other out and establish if the fit will work well for the team and the candidate.


  Teammates have no recruitment targets to make and tend to be honest about their workplace. If they oversell the company to their potential new teammate, they would have to live with the consequences of that on a daily basis. Because team members tend to be honest about the workplace, candidates feel invited to be honest too. Candidates often meet all their future colleagues, tour the premises, are invited to genuinely ask all sorts of questions to determine if it really is a place they feel called to work for. Many Teal Organizations report that their recruitment process and decisions can take significantly longer than usual. They sometimes accept slower growth, keeping a posting open until they find a person that fits not only the job opening but also the organization and its purpose.


  #### **What makes for a good fit**


  Most traditional organizations focus on a person's fit with the job description. Teal organizations tend to take a broader perspective, designing recruitment as a two-way discovery process to answer one fundamental question: Are we meant to journey together?


  ##### ***Fit for role***


  Assessing the fit in terms of skills, experience and expertise remains an important component of the recruitment process, especially for specific roles requiring expertise. Roles in self-managing organizations are exchanged very fluidly, though. For that reason, the "fit for role" is often not considered to be paramount, as it is likely that a person's roles might change quickly. Self-managing organizations experience that when employees are motivated to take on a new and challenging role, they  pick up new skills and experience in surprisingly little time.


  ##### ***Fit with the organization***


  A second area to explore in conversation is: will this person blossom in the organization? Will he or she thrive in a self-organizing environment? Does the person feel aligned by the organization's values? Does he or she "click" with the colleagues? Many Teal organizations, like [Morning Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/), give candidates a training in self-management, so candidates can determine if that is what they want. Other organizations create moments in the recruitment process to have in-depth discussions about the company's and the candidate's values.


  ##### ***Fit with purpose***


  Finally, is the person energized by the organizations’ [purpose](../listening-to-purpose/)? Is there something in the person's history that makes them resonate, makes them want to serve this purpose at this moment in their life? The discussion triggered by these questions can reach substantial depth and help both the candidate and the organization learn more about themselves. Recruitment becomes a process of self-inquiry as much as a process of mutual assessment.


  ##### ***Testing the match***


  Trial periods are common in Teal organizations. Some organizations such as [FAVI ](http://www.favi.com/en/)make extended use of this period for both parties to test whether the match works well in the long run. [Zappos ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zappos)offers its new hires a $3,000 check if they have second thoughts and choose to quit during the four-week orientation. The idea is that everyone will be better off if they don’t stay in what promises to be an unhappy marriage.
faq:
  - question: Is everybody a good fit for a Teal organization? Are there people who
      can't adapt to such a workplace?
    answer: >-
      Some people will be more attracted than others to work in self-managing
      environments, or in places that invite people into wholeness or to engage
      deeply with a specific purpose. The more the recruitment process allows
      candidates to have a deep understanding of the kind of workplace they are
      applying for the higher the chance both the organization and the
      individual may have a clear understanding and might realize the fit is not
      ideal.


      * When it comes to [self-management](../self-management/), the challenge tends to be different, depending on a person's background. If the candidate is used to being a manager or to work in a staff position with power over operating units, it can be a challenging transition. Candidates who have previously worked in the lower levels of the organization may find it hard at first to deal with the higher levels of commitment and personal responsibility that self-management requires.

      * When it comes to [wholeness](../wholeness/): is the person comfortable with an environment where colleagues are expecting each other to be open and vulnerable, to show up from a place of wholeness?

      * When it comes to [evolutionary purpose:](/evolutionary-purpose/) does the person resonate with the organization's purpose, and do they feel ok with an environment in which there is little predict & control, and more sense and respond?


      Traditional organizations that move to Teal find that it is often hard to predict who will thrive in the new environment or not. Some people suddenly blossom, whereas others where everyone predicted they would love it find it hard. So taking time in the recruitment process and building in, when possible, a test period might be helpful to increases chances of a good fit.
  - question: Aren’t teammates tempted to recruit candidates without strong
      personalities, who won't disturb them? Is there not a risk for lack of
      diversity to creep in?
    answer: >-
      The risk exists, just as in any kind of organization, where people prefer
      recruit someone  who looks like them : same age, same experience, same
      initial training. Mitigating that risk is that recruitment is often a team
      affair and not just a single or small groups decision. 


      Some[ Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) have invented processes to preserve diversity (see below RHD  bi-monthly “isms in the workplace meeting”).
