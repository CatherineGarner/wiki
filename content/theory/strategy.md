  介绍传统的战略规划过程在蔚蓝组织中如何呈现。

  ## 新视角


  人类组织的每一个历史阶段都产生了不同的战略视角和截然不同的实践：


  #### **红色组织**


  [红色组织](../red-organizations/)一般不会制定求生存目的之外的长期目标或战略。酋长寻求短期收益以维持权力，并在威胁和机遇出现时对其作出反应。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  [琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)可能会制定战略，但不强调战略，因为世界被视为相对不变和可预测的。所以重点放在过程上。如果有战略，也都是由金字塔最高层负责制定。决策被传令给底层成员，并且只共享必要的信息。


  #### **橙色组织**


  在[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，战略变得更加重要，因为人们越来越被发现世界是动态的。不过，尽管人们认为世界越来越复杂，但仍然认为是可以预测的。战略通常仍然是一个非常自上而下的过程，但已经从命令和控制过渡到预测和控制。为了保持竞争优势，橙色范式得出的结论是，组织的大部分成员必须被授权，并被授予一些独立思考和执行的空间。于是产生了目标管理的做法——最高管理层制定一个总体方向，并将目标和里程碑层层下达到金字塔底，以达到预期的结果。这个过程开发出那些我们都很熟悉的流程，如定期战略规划、年度预算、资产平衡表和关键绩效指标。


  #### **绿色组织**


  在[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，组织结构进一步分散：较低级别的人员越来越得到授权，领导者的一项关键责任就是促进这种授权。不过，绿色组织通常仍然保持着某种等级结构，组织的战略方向主要来自高层。但战略也被纳入了服务的目的，这超越了橙色那种赢得竞争和利润的目的。


  #### **蔚蓝组织**


  在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，权力是分散的。自我管理取代了等级制度。战略思维不仅仅来自高层，而是可以来自组织内任何位置。团队成员可以提建议、倡议计划、建议变更——只要他们在这个过程中与相关倡议协商。活用“建议流程”对此起到了关键的促进作用。战略也与目标密不可分，传统的战略规划被“倾听目标”所取代。

  ## **实践中**


  #### 道法自然的战略


  在传统组织中，由高层决定长期战略——通常是CEO和高级管理团队。通常会通过一个流程来制定战略，这个流程的第一步，是高层管理人员审查一些严格掌握的敏感信息。这些信息可能包括，长期预测的制定，还包括实现预测到的各种机遇所需的计划和解决方案。这些计划成为年度目标，并制定部门分解目标。用详细文件概述预先规划好的航线。新的方向/计划是自上而下传达的。


  在蔚蓝组织中，不存在传统意义上的战略流程和实践。蔚蓝组织并不是由高层确定方向，而是组织中的人通过“倾听”组织目标，获得组织可能被召唤去哪里的开放性感觉。不需要更详细的方向图。因为规划图会把潜在的可能性限制在一个狭窄的、预先规划好的路线上。


  有了组织目标作为指路明灯，无论谁，无论是个人还是集体，都被赋予了自主感知潜在需求的能力。战略会随时随地的有机发生，人们不断培育新想法，并在实地测试它们。组织在集体智慧的活动过程中进化、变形、扩张或收缩。现实是伟大的裁判，替代了首席执行官、董事会或委员会。有效的主意会在组织内部聚集动力和能量而立项；而那些不被接纳无法流行的想法会自然枯萎。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  ##### *Workable solutions, fast iterations*


  Teal organizations don't rely so heavily on the predict and control model. While predicting the future may be helpful in a *complicated* world, it is less relevant in an increasingly *complex* world. Out of this understanding, Teal organizations tend to move to implementing workable solutions, today, that can be improved at any point. Companies are not chained to strategic planning processes, or driven to achieve targets that might be quickly out of date. These companies are freer to progress quickly, via fast iterations, and revise strategies as necessary.


  Jean-François Zobrist at FAVI uses the following metaphor to explain the difference. An airplane like a Boeing 747 is a *complicated* system. There are millions of parts that need to work together seamlessly. But everything can be mapped out; if you change one part, you should be able to predict all the consequences. A bowl of spaghetti is a *complex* system. Even though it has just a few dozen “parts,” it is virtually impossible to predict what will happen when you pull at the end of a strand of spaghetti that sticks out of the bowl.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  ##### *Dynamic Steering*


  Brian Robertson at Holacracy uses a metaphor from the world of agile software development to describe how the planning process differs in Teal organizations:


  *Imagine riding a bicycle the way we manage most modern organizations. You would hold a big meeting to decide the angle at which you should hold the handlebars; you’d map your journey in as much detail as possible, factoring in all known obstacles and the exact timing and degree to which you would need to adjust your course to avoid these. Then you would get on the bicycle, hold the handlebars rigidly at the angle calculated, close your eyes, and steer according to plan. Odds are you would not reach your target, even if you did manage to keep the bicycle upright for the entire trip. When the bicycle falls over, you might ask: “Why didn’t we get this right the first time?” And maybe: “Who screwed up?”*


  *That ridiculous approach isn’t so far from the approach many organizations take to strategic planning. By contrast, Holacracy helps an organization operate more like the way we actually ride a bicycle, using a dynamic steering paradigm. Dynamic steering means constant adjustment in light of real feedback, which makes for a more organic and emergent path. If you watch even the most skilled cyclist, you’ll see a slight but constant weaving, as the rider constantly takes in sensory feedback about his present state and environment, and makes minor corrections to direction, speed, balance, and aerodynamics. Weaving arises because the rider maintains a dynamic equilibrium while moving forward, using rapid feedback to stay within the many constraints of the environment and equipment. Instead of wasting a lot of time and energy predicting exactly the “right” path in advance, he instead holds his purpose in mind, stays present in the moment, and finds the most natural way forward as he goes. That’s not to say the rider doesn’t have a plan or at least some sense of his likely route, just that he gains more control, not less, by surrendering to present reality continuously and trusting his capacity to sense and respond in the moment. Similarly, we have the opportunity to get more control in our organizations by more relentlessly facing reality and adapting continuously. When we become attached to a specific predicted outcome, there’s a risk we will get stuck fighting reality when it doesn’t conform to our prediction.*^\[Robertson, Brian J. (2015-06-02).

  ##### ***Internal communication***


  In Teal, strategy emerges organically from the collective intelligence of everyone in the organization. This collective intelligence is encouraged by sharing company data and information. As everyone is 'in the know', information is available to all to offer strategic suggestions.


  Teal organizations may use 'all-hands meetings' to share important information, and to discuss the organization's response. This reflects trust in the organization's collective intelligence. It also rejects the notion that a only small group of people at the top could master all the complex information necessary to make sound strategic choices.^\[Frederic. Reinventing Organizations (pp110-112). Nelson Parker, 2014.]

      #### **Self-management**


      In Teal organizations, thousands of decisions are made by individuals and teams who are trusted to do the right thing. Plans are not handed down from the top with little room to maneuver. People are trusted to plan, make improvements, and execute.


      #### **Wholeness**


      In Teal, employees are encouraged to bring their 'whole self' to work: the emotional, the intuitive, and the spiritual are all welcome. The workplace becomes more holistic as a result. This allows for, and encourages, reflection and mindfulness. Reflection on the company's purpose and direction is encouraged.


      #### **Evolutionary purpose**


      Because Teal organizations are driven by evolutionary purpose, traditional strategic planning is replaced by the process of listening to purpose. The purpose of an organization is a manifestation of its collective intelligence, and so its direction cannot be mandated from the top down.
  - question: Does that mean that in Teal organizations, anticipatory thinking is
      viewed as a waste of time??
    answer: >-
      Brian Robertson offers the following on this topic:


      *While Holacracy’s approach to strategy resists relying on predictions, that’s not to say all forward-looking projections and anticipatory thinking are useless. In this regard, it’s helpful to understand the difference between a prediction and a projection. “Predict” comes from the Latin præ-, “before,” and dicere, “to say”— thus it literally means “to say before,” or “to foretell, prophesize.” “Project,” on the other hand, is from the Latin pro-, “forward,” and jacere, “to throw”— thus, “to throw forth.” In order to throw forth, you must be firmly grounded in the place you are starting from: the present reality. Getting real data and “throwing it forth” to get a sense of where events are headed is often useful to better understand your context, and it is different than “foretelling and prophesizing” where reality will be in the future.*^[Robertson, Brian J.
