intro: 本文探讨了蔚蓝下的股东结构，并介绍蔚蓝组织所有者的各种类型。
perspective: >-
  ## 新视角


  股东和蔚蓝的关系很微妙。传统上，股东是一个适用于“营利”实体的概念。从严格的法律角度来看，现代“营利”组织，无论是独资企业、合伙企业还是有限公司，其存在的主要目的是为其所有者提供经济回报。事实上，发达国家围绕“营利”组织建立的整个法律框架反映了这样一种假设，公认利益是这类组织的目的。但正如本知识库在其他章节已经详细讨论过的那样，蔚蓝组织的目的远不止为其所有者提供经济回报。


  在蔚蓝模式中，目标优先于利润。这就需要超越橙色的股东至上观点，甚至也要超越绿色之重视多方利益相关者的观点。在蔚蓝阶段，虽然实现组织目标可能需要财政投资，而财政投资又可能使投资者在本组织中拥有合法的发言权，并有权获得公平的投资回报，但蔚蓝组织的存在并不仅仅是为股东服务。


  从更扩展的角度来看，股东的概念可能会被诸如[公仆](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship)的概念所取代。如果蔚蓝组织是个活生生的生命体，人怎么可能拥有其整个或部分百分比？人怎么可能拥有一个（如蔚蓝组织这样一个）想要自我显化的能量呢？甚至人怎么可能拥有资产--比如制造机器的金属呢？人类才刚刚开始审视这些疑问，还没有得到真正的答案。在当今世界，股东已深深载入各组织必须遵守的法律框架。我们还没有发明或开始定义组织的“公仆”到底意味着什么（参见下面的“实践中”章节）。


  当今，我们对这种的划线区分是“营利性”和“非营利性”。也许引入股东作“公仆”这类模式的运作时，会让这种区别变得模糊，并据此发明一种崭新的更广泛适用的被法律承认的组织形式。


  有关股东的历史观点如下：


  #### 红色组织


  在[R红色组织](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/theory/red-organizations/)中，股东往往是一个毫无意义的概念。因为其领导的合法性更多地来源于权力而不是某种所有权的建构。组织的目的是关于聚集进一步的权力，而不是经济回报。红色组织对股东的认知，通常跟领导权混为一谈。领导者也是所有者或股东家族的关键代表。


  #### 琥珀组织


  在[A琥珀组织](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Amber_Organizations)中，股东通常同样是一个不协调的概念。琥珀组织通常有一个目的，但不是财务回报。军队、教会或政府机构没有“所有者”。在一定程度上，营利实体如果在琥珀范式下运作，通常会尝试在财务回报与其他目标（如自我保护）之间取得平衡。通常是家族所有制，股东会限制追求利润最大化，目的是有利于维持遗产等利益。


  #### 橙色组织


  在[橙色模式](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Orange_Organizations)下，股东的概念变得至高无上。典型橙色组织的根本目的就是为其所有者提供财务回报。这已经反映在现代关于公司的法律结构中，股东根据其持股比例拥有管理的最终权力。管理层在法律上有义务为股东寻求经济回报。这导致了组织股东的广泛分散性，并可以通过流通股等机制改变股东。每一个所有者可能拥有一个微小的、可变的股份，但所有人都团结在一起追求经济利益。


  #### 绿色组织


  [绿色模式](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Green_Organizations)通过强调所有利益相关者（成员、客户、社区、供应商以及股东）的重要性，替代了橙色对股东和财务问题的关注。因此，即使是“营利性”组织也不仅仅是为了所有者的利益：还应该考虑到其活动中包含的多种利益。企业社会责任（CSR）运动就是从这个角度出发的。


  Generally however, for-profit Green organizations do not have a different ownership structure than Orange organizations. When the owners of a Green organization all share the Green perspective, this tends not to create a problem. However, should some owners differ in their view of the importance of financial returns, conflict can ensue.

  Ownership in Teal organizations can take a number of forms. It may be
  concentrated or dispersed, private or public, and this diversity has been in
  evidence at least to some extent in those Teal organizations that have so far
  come into being. Having said that, there is at least strong evidence that in
  whatever form, the owners of Teal organizations must understand and embrace a
  Teal worldview. While it is not clear that a Teal perspective is necessarily
  incompatible with profit and wealth maximization (one might argue that Teal
  can maximize these even as a by product of its evolutionary purpose), it is
  certainly true that many might believe this to be so. Thus, a Teal
  organization with owners who do not necessarily subscribe to a Teal worldview
  is at risk that such owners (as a result of the legal rights typically
  conferred upon them) can force the abandonment of Teal practices when they
  seem to conflict with, or be less effective in terms of pursuing the more
  traditional objective of profit (see BSO/Origin and AES under “Concrete
  examples for inspiration” below).


  Certain legal developments have emerged to address this potential conflict, but they are not yet widespread. In the United States, some states recognize a “benefit corporation” as a type of for-profit entity that includes positive impact on society, workers, the community and the environment in addition to profit in its legally defined goals. In for-profit companies as we currently know them (the so-called C-Corporations), the organizations’ directors have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders, and to the shareholders only. They face the prospect of civil claims if they stray from their fiduciary duties by taking environmental or social concerns into account at the expense of shareholders. The duty of directors of benefit corporations is extended to include non-financial interests, such as social benefit, concerns of employees and suppliers, and environmental impact.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  A much older but still somewhat rare structure is the cooperative, where ownership is placed with members (consumer cooperative) and/or employees (worker cooperative). However, while these organizations are presumably freed from a strict pursuit of profit, their purpose is to serve a single stakeholder group.


  Holacracy has drafted a constitution that a board can adopt and make binding, even to future shareholders. It gives shareholders a legitimate say in finance matters, but prevents them from unilaterally imposing a strategy, or from reverting to traditional management practices. Holacracy has done the legal footwork to make its constitution fit within US corporate law, and it is currently adapting the constitution to legal systems in other countries.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

faq:
  - question: Teal organizations don't seem to encourage employee ownership. How come?
    answer: >-
      Wouldn't employees be more motivated, feel more part of the organization
      if they were to also own parts of it? Couldn't this help diminish income
      inequality?


      1. Employee ownership is often thought of as a way to bind employees, especially the most talented and skilled, to the organization. From a Teal perspective that makes little sense. People should be free to pursue their calling. While that calling intersects with the purpose of the organization, then let people be part of it. And let them be free to leave when it is no longer the case. Profit sharing is an easy way for employees to benefit, but without having to buy stock, or be bought out, at a good or bad time.

      2. Employee ownership is often thought of as a way to "motivate" employees. Under Teal, intrinsic motivation (such as purpose) is considered much more powerful than extrinsic factors like financial compensation.

      3. Employee ownership is sometimes thought of as a way to give employees power and a voice. If employees have voting rights, they cannot simply be ignored. A self-managing structure distributes power anyway, and removes the need to do so via voting rights.

      4. Employee ownership is sometimes seen as a way to reduce income inequality by allowing employees to share in the value creation of the organization. This is valid when it comes to young organizations that might rapidly increase in value and have limited cash resources. In more established companies, income inequality can often more easily be reduced through salary setting and profit sharing.
