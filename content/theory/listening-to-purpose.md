  此章的背景文档是进化目标，其中已经详细描绘过，蔚蓝组织的一个决定性特点是，决策和行动的动力和方向，都是达成组织目标的愿望。蔚蓝组织的目标会与时俱进的变化，与利益最大化和打败竞争对手这样的传统目标完全不同。如果我们承认，一个有目标的组织，具有其本身的成长能量和方向感，并且其成员的任务就是跟随组织的真正方向而不是刻意去引导它，那么问题是，“我们如何知道组织想去哪里？”这个提问引出一个蔚蓝组织的关键流程，经常被称为聆听目标。

  #### 努力去感知（直觉而非思考）


  如何去发现一个组织的方向，最简单的回答是：无为。让自我管理机制创造奇迹。关于蔚蓝流程经常会出现一个词语：感知。我们都是自然的传感器。我们都有天赋，能感知到某件事是否有进展，或感知到一个新机遇。（与高次元意识的沟通--直觉）。在自我管理流程下，每个人都可以做感知器，去初始化一些改变--正如生命器官中每个细胞都能感受环境并将改变需求报告给器官。我们无法停止感知。感知无处无时不在，但在传统组织内，信息一般会被滤掉。只有那些在金字塔顶被感知到的讯号，才有机会得到反应和行动（靠塔顶的智慧而非集体智慧）。但不幸的是，这些讯号经常会在传达中被高度扭曲或偏离现场真相。霍尔的布莱恩使用一个有力的比喻来谈论传统组织如何过滤人们感知环境的能力：


  > 发生在我身上的一次变革的“偶然”经历，是当我差点撞毁一架飞机的时刻发生的。当时我是一名学生飞行员，在单飞不久，“低电压”灯亮了。所有其他的仪表都在告诉我“一切都很好”，所以我忽略了它。就像我们在组织生活中，当一个单独的“仪表”（一个成员）感觉到一些其他人没有经历过的事情而提醒时，一般会因不理解而被忽略（进而失去回避困境的机会）。事实证明，在驾驶飞机时，忽视一个关键的仪表是一个非常糟糕的决定。这个经历有助于促进我寻找恰当的组织方法，不再因同样的盲目性而体验困境——一个组织，该如何充分重视利用每个成员的感应器仪表，而不“忽略那个低压灯”？^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09) Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 4383-4394).

  Brian goes on to say, “… getting clear on purpose is more like detective work than like creative work. What you are looking for is already there, waiting to be found— it is no more a decision than your child’s purpose is. Simply ask yourself: “On the basis of our current context and the resources, talents, and capacities at our disposal, the products or services we offer, the history of the company and its market space, and so on, what’s the deepest potential it can help create or manifest in the world? Why does the world need it?”^\[Robertson, Brian J. (2015-06-02). Holacracy: The New Management System for a Rapidly Changing World (Kindle Locations 482-485). Henry Holt and Co.. Kindle Edition.]


  While people are naturally gifted sensors, we can increase our capacity to sense with practice. Meditative or spiritual practices, in particular, can help us distance ourselves from self-centered needs and tap into broader sources of wisdom.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  #### The Empty Chair


  A simple, less esoteric practice to listen in to an organization’s purpose consists of allocating an empty chair at any meeting to represent the organization and its evolutionary purpose. Anybody participating in the meeting can, at any time, change seats, to listen to and become the voice of the organization. The empty chair can be used explicitly or as a guiding voice in our heads. Here are some questions one might tune into while sitting in that chair:


  • Have the decisions and the discussion served you (the organization) well?


  • How are you at the end of this meeting?


  • What stands out to you from today’s meeting?


  • In what direction do you want to go? At what speed? Are we being bold enough? Too bold?


  • Is there something else that needs to be said or discussed?^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 4432-4437). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  Heiligenfeld, an operator of mental health facilities in Germany, uses a practice with a similar effect. As part of every meeting, someone is asked to volunteer to take possession of a pair of tingsha bells, two small hand cymbals that can make a beautiful, crystal-like sound. Whenever the person feels that ground rules are not being respected, or that the meeting is serving egos more than purpose, she can make the cymbals sing. The rule is that no one can speak until the last sound of the cymbal has died out— which takes a surprisingly long time. During the silence, participants are to reflect on the question: “Am I in service to the topic we are discussing and to the organization?” Colleagues are now so used to this practice that simply reaching out to the cymbals is all it takes to get a meeting back on track.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  #### Large Group Processes


  While the empty chair is typically used on a day-to-day basis, when an organization faces a major inflection point, there are a number of more elaborate processes that can help large groups of people to listen in jointly to their organization’s purpose and sense of direction. These processes include Otto Scharmer’s “Theory U,” David Cooperrider’s “Appreciative Inquiry,” Marvin Weisbord and Sandra Janoff’s “Future Search,” “World Café,” "Liberating Structures" and Harrison Owen’s “Open Space.”


  These processes are non-hierarchical and self-organizing. They often bring the “whole system” into the room: all colleagues of an organization, whether a few dozen, hundreds, or thousands, come together for a working session of one or several days. Clients, partners, and suppliers can be invited to join, to add their perspective to the inquiry. Each of these processes comes with its particular format, but they have one thing in common: they achieve the unlikely feat of giving everybody a voice (even when thousands of people are involved), while at the same time channeling these voices toward a valuable collective outcome.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  #### Outside Prompting


  Teal organizations seem to have found that when a company is clear about its purpose, the outside world comes knocking at its door with opportunities. Sometimes it feels as if it isn’t only people inside the organization sensing where it wants to go, but people from the outside, too. At Buurtzorg for example, by now, people from all sorts of backgrounds get in touch with Jos de Blok and others in the organization to explore ideas that could shape where Buurtzorg might go next. De Blok and his colleagues accept these meetings and listen with open minds. When the discussion seems promising, they set up experiments and see what happens. There are no committees, no stage-gate processes, no set budgets. It really is that simple: discussions take place and things evolve from there. The feeling is that what is meant to happen will happen.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

faq:
  - question: How can we be sure the purpose is well known in the organization and
      that the decision-making process is based on it?
    answer: "One suggestion is to use tools like surveys or periodic group
      discussions to address this issue. At Buurtzorg, Jos de Blok and others
      talk about purpose all the time, but have never written down the
      organization’s purpose in the form of a mission statement. They find that
      keeping it oral keeps it alive and evolving and prevents it from becoming
      constraining.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A
      Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human
      Consciousness (Kindle Locations 4352-4354). Nelson Parker. Kindle
      Edition.]"
  - question: Do Teal organizations then abandon the traditional process of
      strategic planning?
