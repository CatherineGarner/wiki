  ## 新视角


  办公室传统上一直是一种，鼓励人们展示一个狭隘而自律的职业形象，将所有其他个人特质都挡在门外的空间。职场通常要求我们只展示理性的正面素质，展示刚毅和坚强，隐藏怀疑和怯懦。理性是王道，情感、直觉和我们的灵性侧面一般不受欢迎，或不合时宜。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 1310-1313). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  是什么力量让我们抛弃和那么多珍贵的自我素质而去办公室呢？这是恐惧阴谋的效果，这种恐惧机制对成员和组织同样生效。组织一侧的恐惧是，如果人们将完整的自我带进办公室，那些情绪、癖好，以及休闲服饰等会让办公室变得混乱无序。军队早就知晓，只要果让人们感觉到自己是随时可以互相替代的同规格存在，就会很容易施加控制。职员一侧的恐惧则是，如果在工作环境展示出自己的全部真实侧面，会暴露自我而遭到差评或嘲笑，被看作怪人或不合群者。于是人人都认为安全起见，应该将自我隐藏在一个职业形象面具背后。


  全球的古老智慧都从更深层面剖析了这个主题：在心灵深处，我们都真实的互联成一体，每个人都是有机整体的单元，但我们已经遗忘了这个真相。我们出生就进入身份分离的文化环境，在成长过程中也被教育洗脑而感觉到与自己更深特质的分离，以及与周围其他人和生命体的分离。这些古老智慧告诉我们，咱们最深层的生命意义即使命，就是在自己内在以及跟外在世界的联系中，重新找回这种固有的完整性。这个灵性洞见激活了蔚蓝组织的第二个突破：力图建造一个，能支撑我们回归完整人性之旅途的空间。当我们敢于脱下面具，将自己的全部素质带入工作中，就会开始发生很多奇迹。每当我们将完整自己的某个部分用伪善隐藏起来，我们就将自己的一部分潜力，或创造力以及能量丢弃了。这就是为何很多办公室都感觉毫无生命力。在完整人性中我们的生命力是圆满的。我们会惊诧的发现，在自己内部蕴藏着超乎想象的丰满生命力。在同事关系角度，很多让办公室不舒服或低效能量也会消失。工作成为一种承载方式，我们在那里互相帮助对方揭示自己的内在壮丽并创化实现自己的使命。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  ## 实践中


  Teal Organizations have developed a consistent set of practices that invite us to reclaim our inner wholeness and bring all of who we are to work.


  ### Self-management


  Self-management goes a long way toward helping us show up more fully. With no scarce promotions to fight for, no bosses to please, and no adversaries to elbow aside, much of the political poison is drained out of organizations. Without a boss looking over our shoulder, without employees to keep in line and peers that could turn into competitors, we can finally let our guard down and simply focus on the work we want to do.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 3144-3147). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  ### Safe and supportive environment


  Beyond self-management, Teal organizations create an environment in which people support each other in their inner work while doing the outer work of the organization. Teal organizations recognize that every time our fears get triggered is an opportunity to learn and grow into more wholeness, reclaiming aspects of ourselves that we have neglected or pushed into the shadows. They believe that if we are to invite all of who we are to show up, including the shy inner voice of the soul, we need to create safe and caring spaces at work. We must learn to discern and be mindful of the subtle ways our words and actions undermine safety and trust in a community of colleagues.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 3176-3226). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  ### Explicit ground rules


  Teal Organizations spend significant time and energy training everybody in ground rules that support healthy and productive collaboration. Many end up writing down these ground rules in a document. RHD has its detailed *Bill of Rights and Responsibilities*; Morning Star its documents called *Organizational Vision, Colleague Principles*, and *Statement of General Business Philosophy*; FAVI has its *fiches*, and Holacracy its *Constitution*. These documents provide a vision for a safe and productive workplace. They give colleagues a vocabulary to discuss healthy relationships, and they draw lines that separate recommended from unacceptable behaviors.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 3358-3362). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  ### Reflective spaces


  Wisdom traditions insist on the need for regular silence and reflection to quiet the mind and let truth emerge from a deeper part of ourselves. An increasing number of people pick up contemplative practices— meditation, prayer, yoga, walking in nature— and integrate these into their daily lives. Many Teal organizations have set up a quiet room somewhere in the office, and others have put meditation and yoga classes in place. This practice opens up space for individual reflection and mindfulness in the middle of busy days. A number of them go a step further: they also create collective moments for self-reflection through practices such as group coaching, team supervision, large-group reflections, and days of silence. ^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  ### Storytelling


  If we want workplaces of trust, if we hope for deep, rich, and meaningful relationships, we have to reveal more of who we are. It has become fashionable in many companies, when teams don’t collaborate well, to call for a team-building event. Going bowling together can be a fun break from work, but such activities are generally “more of the same”: they keep to the surface and don’t really foster trust or community at any deep level. These events lack the essential element we have used to build community and create shared narratives since the dawn of time: the practice of storytelling. We have lost track of the power of stories to bring us together, and in the process, we have let communal relations dwindle and erode. We need to recover the power of storytelling, as author Parker Palmer tells us:^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 3486-3495). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  *The more you know about another person’s journey, the less possible it is to distrust or dislike that person. Want to know how to build relational trust? Learn more about each other. Learn it through simple questions that can be tucked into the doing of work, creating workplaces that not only employ people but honor the soul in the process.*^\[Parker Palmer, “On the Edge: Have the Courage to Lead with Soul,” Journal for Staff Development, National Staff Development Council, Spring 2008.]


  ### Meetings


  Teal organizations typically have instituted specific meeting practices to help participants keep their egos in check and interact with each other from a place of wholeness. Some are very simple, while others much more elaborate. At Sounds True, every meeting starts with a minute of silence to help people ground themselves in the moment. Many Teal companies start meetings with a round of check-in and finish with a round of check-out.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 3573-3577). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.] See [Meetings](../meetings/)


  ### Managing Conflict


  It’s easy in our relationships with colleagues to fall prey to our desire to please or to impress, to be liked, or to dominate. We easily intrude on others or let them intrude on us. Our soul knows the right boundaries, and sometimes it tells us we need conflict to set them in the right place. Without conflict, we can be over-accommodating or over-protective, and in both cases, we stop being true to ourselves when interacting with colleagues. Teal organizations have developed specific practices to identify and resolve conflict.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 3630-3634). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.] See [Conflict resolution](../conflict-resolution/).


  ### Physical Spaces


  Most places of work insidiously signal that we are in a place somehow removed from normal life, and they call us to behave differently than we would in other environments. Teal organizations create physical spaces that invite workers to bring more of themselves to the job. Sounds True welcomes workers’ dogs to the office and installed not just a microwave but a full stove in the kitchen to encourage a sense of community in which people could cook and eat together. At Buurtzorg, nurses are encouraged to decorate their small community offices to make them their own. At FAVI, teams have chosen colors to paint the machines in their area and have decorated the shop floor with posters, plants and aquariums. Many Teal organizations spend significant resources on facilitating workers’ connection with nature so that they can slow down and find a deeper connection with themselves and the world: Sun Hydraulics located all its factories next to a lake; Sounds True defied the convention of fixed windows that would ensure centralized temperature control and opted for more expensive windows that could open to the outside.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 3692-3707). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  ### Personal development


  Through these practices, a safe space is created. Then, each person is responsible to follow his/her own process of self–awareness and personal development. The daily practices that Teal organization offer, such as reflective space, storytelling, meetings without ego and conflict resolution methodologies, are the tools each person has available to define and follow his way. And only in this process of matching such an organizational approach with the individual’s responsibility for self-growth, can self-management and listening to purpose flourish.


  ### Reimagined HR processes


  In addition to the practices described above, Teal organizations have reframed all of the key human resources processes— recruitment, onboarding, training, evaluation, compensation, dismissal— in ways to eliminate fear and feelings of separation and reclaim wholeness.
