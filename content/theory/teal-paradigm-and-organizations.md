  > *二十一世纪最令人兴奋的突破不会因科技而发生，而是对人性真正意义的广泛传播。*--约翰 奈斯比特


  蔚蓝模式是人类意识进化的下一个阶段。^\[这个意识阶段类比于 Gebser’s 所说的“积分体,” Loevinger’s所说的 “集合体,” Cook-Greuter’s 的“结构性觉知,” Kegan’s 的“互联个体,” Torbert’s 的“战略家” 和 “炼金者,” Graves’ 的“AN,” Spiral Dynamics’ 的“黄色意识,” Maslow’s 的“自我创化,” Wade’s的 “至高主权,” 以及其他（造翼者的主权积分体）; 最普遍的称呼是积分体，共同体，集合体。]蔚蓝意识运用在组织机构角度时，就是将组织看作一种独立存在的力量，拥有其本身的目标，而不仅仅是一种实现管理目的的载具。蔚蓝组织的特点是自我组织和自我管理。橙色历史阶段的传统等级制度，即”预测和控制“的金字塔，被一种由许多小团队组成的去中心结构所替代。这些团队负责自我经营管理，能主权决定与组织内其他细胞的互动方式。传统的角色任命和岗位定义，被一人复数岗位的方式替代。蔚蓝岗位一般由成员自我选择决定并具有流动性。成员的行动不是由指令系统链条上游的某个上司命令来指导，而是通过成员”聆听“组织的目标来自行安排。蔚蓝结构组织的特点是，能敏捷变化，具有良好的适应性，为更好的服务于组织的目标而自动进行着微调。这跟传统的 [琥珀](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/), [橙色](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/) 和 [绿色](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)组织都很不同。


  #### 蔚蓝意识阶段


  要理解蔚蓝组织模式，需要先理解人类意识的不同阶段，意识的层级是此蔚蓝模式的依据。前卫心理学家[阿伯拉汉 马斯洛](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Maslow)以及其他一些作家都认为，意识从绿色阶段朝向蔚蓝阶段的转型，是人类旅程中的一个特殊里程碑--另一位因发展模式研究而著称的心理学家[ C克蕾雅 W 格瑞夫](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_W._Graves) 的看法，在被沿袭引用时提到：“第一阶意识”（1.0），代表绿色意识层级之前所有的意识阶段，“第二阶意识”（2.0），则代表从蔚蓝意识阶段开始的各种未来意识阶段。所有处于第一阶意识阶段的人都认为，只有自己的世界观是唯一正确的，其他人都犯了很危险的错误。^\[To oversimplify: people who see the world differently are weaklings to be taken advantage of (Red), heretics to be brought back to the one true way (Blue), fools who don’t know how to play the game of success (Orange), or intolerant people who won’t give everyone a voice (Green).

  ##### 驯服自大人格的恐惧


  意识的每一次转型，都发生于人类开始有能力伸展到一种更有优势的视点，能从更加扩展的认知来观察这个世界的时刻。如一条鱼初次跃出水面，初次能看到水。要获得新见解我们需要从以前淹没着自己的某种身份认知中解脱出来。比如，人类朝向追求合群的琥珀阶段的转型，是当冲动红色意识内呈现出一些内在规则，允许自己从只聚焦于欲望满足的身份认知中解脱出来时发生的。琥珀朝向成功橙色的转型，则发生于琥珀意识从群体雷同这种身份认知中挣脱出来的时刻。当我们学会将自己从自大人格的认知中解脱出来后，就能实现朝向蔚蓝意识的转型。通过退后一些距离观察自己的人格，我们可以突然观察到人格的各种恐惧，野心，以及通常驱动着我们人生的各种欲望。我们开始学会最小化自己的控制欲，彰显美好的愿望（装好人），从众欲等。我们不再因自大人格受辱而发脾气，不再让人格的恐惧条件反射式的控制自己的人生。在这个过程中，我们腾出空间聆听其他人和自己更深内在身份的智慧。


  是什么替代了恐惧？是信任生命本就丰盛的能力。所有古老智慧都提到一个重要真相，提到两种基本的生活方式：基于恐惧与缺乏，或基于信任与丰盛。在进化性蔚蓝意识阶段，我们越过一道鸿沟，学会去压制自己对人和事的控制欲。我们终于学会相信，即使发生了某些不可预测的事，或即使做错了事，一切都还是会好转，并且相信，即使不能好转，生命依然会给我们一个学习和成长的机会。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Location 1108-1119). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  ##### 内在正义感的导航


  当我们被自大触发，就会被迫因外在要素而做出决策— 会被他人的看法，或结果如何等要素制约（而失去主权决策能力）。在冲动红色的见解中，好决策的标准就是能否帮助自己得到所求。在合群琥珀见解中，人们则根据与社会主流的适配性做出决策。那些超越了个人家族，宗教或社会阶层认定常识的决策，会带来罪恶感和羞辱感。在成功学橙色见解中，效果和成果是决策的标杆。在多元化绿色见解中，决策标准则是归属感与和谐一致感。在进化性蔚蓝见解中，我们的决策依据，从外在标杆转型到内在尺度。我们关注内在正义感：这个决定感觉对不？我是否对自己真诚？这是否符合我感觉到的那个内在身份呼唤？我是否在服务世界？


  如果能按捺自大人格，我们就有能力做出一些看起来有风险的决策—不必衡量所有可能的结果，只是跟随那个最深内在的坚毅共鸣。我们就能开发出一种对不妥状况的直觉敏感性，感觉到一些需要我们开口和采取行动的状况，即使遭到反对或成功概率不大，也会出于整体感和使命感而做出决策。旧模式中的认可、成果、财富、和归属感，都被看作是值得推崇的体验，但同时隐含着诱惑自大的陷阱。蔚蓝模式跟之前各种意识阶段不同，目的与结果的顺序发生了改变：追求认可、成果、财富和归属感，并不是精彩人生的必要条件。我们追求一种精彩的活法，其结果会自然的带来认可、成果、财富和爱。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Location 1121-1134). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  ##### 生命是展开中的旅程


  在之前的各个意识阶段，对爱、认可、成功的追求，缓慢的塑造了我们的人生，却导致一个不可避免的结果。用诗人美撒同的话说，就是“戴着别人的面具”（我们复制着英雄、榜样、崇拜对象等的面孔给自己戴上）。在蔚蓝意识阶段，我们开始校准内在正义感，致力于诱发一些心灵探索，去发现自己到底是谁，人生目标到底是什么等。人们终于发现，人生的终极目的不是成功或被爱，而是成为自己最真诚的表达，活在自我主权中，荣耀自己的人权礼物和使命，为人类和这个世界服务。在蔚蓝意识中，人生仿佛是一场个人和集体组成的，朝向自己真正身份展开中的旅程。


  这很类似古老年代的那个哥白尼革命，告诉我们说，只要用心就可以变成任何想要成为的人。如果我们遵循蔚蓝模式，就不是去设定自己的人生目标，并用来导航人生的方向。而是放下控制，聆听那个希望透过我们来表达自己的整体生命的引导。帕克剖莫是个作家，教育家和艺术家，关于人生和职业的见解，他在著书“*让你的生命开口*”中写下了美妙的词句：


  > *在对职业的理解背后藏着一个，自大人格不想听的真相，因为那个真相威胁着人格的遮羞布：每个人都拥有一个跟那个日常意识之“小我”不同的生命，是试图通过这个“小我”表达的整体生命，“小我”只是那个生命的容器。...要感觉到这两者的不同，需要长时间艰难体验的磨砺，才可能感觉到那个藏在被称为“我”的人生体验背后的流动，那个更深层、更真实、一如既往的静候着被我们讴歌的生命。^\[Source:23 Parker Palmer, Let Your Life Speak: Listening for the Voice of Vocation (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2000), 5.]*


  很多人通过冥想、聚焦、武术、瑜伽、或单纯在大自然中散步，来催化这个朝向意识2.0阶段的转型，找到一个安静空间，允许内在灵魂的声音吐露其真相并指导人生。活在这个意识阶段见解中的个体，连接着一种更深层的目标，可以几乎毫无恐惧的追求自己的使命。他们掌控了虚荣心和自大人格，不再因恐惧失败而放弃尝试。克蕾雅格瑞夫有一句名言，说具有蔚蓝意识的人是“一个有抱负但无野心的人”。


  蔚蓝个体的动力是，通过成长到达真实自我并跟随使命召唤努力奋斗。他们有时因过于笃定，甚至会对某些人和事失去耐心。比如一些并非来自同样意识境界的、依然追求自大人格成长的人，或一些与自己的境界和人生目标无法共鸣的事物。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  ##### Building on strengths


  When we set goals for our life that are disconnected from our deeper selfhood, when we wear other people’s faces, we don’t stand in the strength of our selfhood. Inevitably we will find ourselves lacking and invest much energy in trying to overcome our weaknesses, or in blaming ourselves or others for not being who we think we ought to be.


  When we see our life as a journey of unfolding toward our true nature, we can look more gently and realistically at our limitations and be at peace with what we see. Life is not asking us to become anything that isn’t already seeded in us. We also tend to focus less on what is wrong or missing in people and situations around us and move our attention instead to what is there, to the beauty and the potential. We trade in judgment for compassion and appreciation.


  Psychologists talk about a shift from a deficit to a strength-based paradigm. Slowly, this shift is making profound inroads in different fields, from management to education, from psychology to health care — starting with the premise that, as human beings, we are not problems waiting to be solved, but potential waiting to unfold.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Location 1158-1167). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  ##### Dealing gracefully with adversity


  When life is seen as a journey of discovery, then we learn to deal more gracefully with the setbacks, the mistakes, and the roadblocks in our life. We can start to grasp the spiritual insight that there are no mistakes, simply experiences that point us to a deeper truth about ourselves and the world. In previous stages, life’s roadblocks (an illness, a bad boss, a difficult marriage) are seen as unfair rolls of the dice. We meet them with anger, shame, or blame, and these feelings disconnect us from others and ourselves. In Teal, obstacles are seen as life’s way to teach us about ourselves and about the world. We are ready to let go of anger, shame, and blame, which are useful shields for the ego but poor teachers for the soul. We embrace the possibility that we played a part in creating the problem, and inquire what we can learn so as to grow from it.


  In earlier paradigms, we often convince ourselves that everything is all right until a problem has snowballed and hits us like an avalanche, forcing change into our life. Now, we tend to make frequent small adjustments, as we learn and grow from problems we encounter along the way. In previous stages, change on a personal level feels threatening. As of Evolutionary-Teal, there is often an enjoyable tension in the journey of personal growth. ^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  ##### Wisdom beyond rationality


  In Orange, rationality is king and rules unquestioned in the pursuit of the decision that will yield the best outcome. Any source of insight other than facts and logical reasoning is “irrational” and must be discarded. Ironically, however, Orange’s attachment to outcomes often clouds the ability to see reality clearly. Amid the stacks of information that are meant to inform complex decisions, we can fail to see information that is incongruous with our worldview or with the future our ego has projected and is attached to; often the writing was all over the wall, and yet people dismissed the clues (or didn’t dare to speak up). Teal, less attached to outcomes, can more easily accept the sometimes unpleasant truths of reality; therefore, rational thinking within Teal can be more accurately informed by data.


  Beyond facts and figures, cognition at this stage taps a broader range of sources to support decision making. The Orange modern-scientific perspective is wary of emotions that could cloud our ability to reason rationally, whereas Green sometimes goes to the other extreme, rejecting analytical “left brain” approaches for “right brain” feeling as a basis for decision-making. Teal is happy to tap into all the domains of knowing. There are insights to be gained from analytical approaches. There is also wisdom to be found in emotions, if we learn to inquire into their significance: Why am I angry, fearful, ambitious, or excited? What does this reveal about me or about the situation that is unfolding?


  Wisdom can be found in intuition, too. Intuition honors the complex, ambiguous, paradoxical, non-linear nature of reality; we unconsciously connect patterns in a way that our rational mind cannot. Intuition is a muscle that can be trained, just like logical thinking: when we learn to pay attention to our intuitions, to honor them, to question them for the truth and guidance they might contain, more intuitive answers will surface.


  Many people believe that there are answers to be found in yet deeper sources. Wisdom traditions and transpersonal psychology trust that if we don’t simply ask a question, but live a question, the universe in its abundance may give us clues to the answer in unexpected events and synchronicity or in words and images that arise in dreams and meditations. Non-ordinary states of consciousness — meditative states, contemplative states, visionary experiences, flow, peak experiences — are available at any stage of consciousness, but from Teal onward, people often take on regular practices to deepen their experience in these states and access the full spectrum of human experience.^\[Ken Wilber makes the critical distinction between stages of consciousness and states of consciousness. States refer to the ephemeral, passing type of consciousness, while stages are longer-lasting structures that people grow into. States include waking consciousness, dreaming, sleeping, altered states (induced for instance by meditation, hypnosis, psychodrama, or drugs) and peak states of mystical experience. (Wilber generally uses the categorizations of gross, subtle, causal, witnessing, and non-dual). States and stages sometimes get confused, because the language of peak experience is often similar to the language that describes the highest stages, but they are two distinct properties of consciousness (with quadrants, lines, and types being third, fourth, and fifth properties in Wilber’s integral model). Say someone has a state of peak mystical experience while generally operating from the Conformist-Amber stage: the peak state does not propel the person to bypass the Orange, Green, Teal, and subsequent stages of development to reach the top of the ladder. The person is still operating from Amber, as will be clear when he or she is again in a state of waking consciousness. Wilber and Combs have found evidence that any state can be experienced at every stage. For instance, people can take up meditative and other altered state practices at any stage. From Teal onward, there is a marked interest in taking up regular practices of non-ordinary consciousness to access the full spectrum of human experience. ^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 6916-6927). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  Another cognitive breakthrough is the ability to reason in paradox, transcending the simple either-or with more complex both-and thinking. Breathing in and breathing out provides an easy illustration of the difference. In either-or thinking, we see them as opposites. In both-and thinking, we view them as two elements that need each other: the more we can breathe in, the more we can breathe out. The paradox is easy to grasp for breathing in and out; it is less obvious for some of the great paradoxes of life that we only start to truly understand when we reach Teal: freedom and responsibility, solitude and community, tending to the self and tending to others.


  Put this all together — a fearless rationality and the wisdom that can be found in emotions, intuition, events, and paradoxes — and Evolutionary-Teal turns the page from the rational-reductionist worldview of Orange and the post-modern worldview of Green to a holistic approach to knowing.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Location 1179-1207). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  ##### Striving for wholeness


  Disidentifying from the ego is one more step of liberation on the human journey. But with disidentification comes separation, and people operating at this stage often develop a keen sense of how far we have let separation fragment our lives and how much it has cost us. We have let our busy egos trump the quiet voice of our soul; many cultures often celebrate the mind and neglect the body; value the masculine above the feminine; and many of us have lost community and our innate connection with nature.


  With this stage comes a deep yearning for wholeness — bringing together the ego and the deeper parts of the self; integrating mind, body, and soul; cultivating both the feminine and masculine parts within; being whole in relation to others; and repairing our broken relationship with life and nature. Often the shift to Teal comes with an opening to a transcendent spiritual realm and a profound sense that at some level, we are all connected and part of one big whole. After many successive steps of disidentification, as we learn to be fully independent and true to ourselves, it dawns on us that, paradoxically, we are profoundly part of everything.


  This longing for wholeness is at odds with the separation that most existing workplaces foster, albeit unconsciously — overemphasizing the ego and the rational while negating the spiritual and emotional; separating people based on the departments they work in, their rank, background, or level of performance; separating the professional from the personal; separating the organization from its competitors and the ecosystem it is embedded in.


  Vocabulary we use is often revealing: in organizations, we often speak about “work-life balance” a notion that shows how little life is left in work when we have separated ourselves from so much that truly matters. For people transitioning to Teal, these separations in the workplace often become so painful that they choose to leave organizational life for some form of self-employment, a more accommodating context to find wholeness with themselves and with others.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Location 1209-1224). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  ##### Wholeness in relation to others


  In Evolutionary-Teal, we can transcend the opposites of judgment and tolerance. In earlier stages, when we disagree with other people, we often meet them in judgment, believing that we must be right and they must be wrong. Our task then is to convince, teach, fix, or dismiss them. Or we can, in the name of tolerance, the Green ideal, gloss over our differences and affirm that all truths are equally valid. In Teal, we can transcend this polarity and integrate with the higher truth of non-judgment we can examine our belief and find it to be superior in truth and yet embrace the other as a human being of fundamentally equal value.


  In the absence of judgment, relationships take on a new quality. Our listening is no longer limited to gathering information so as to better convince, fix, or dismiss. We can create a shared space safe from judgment, where our deep listening helps others to find their voice and their truth, just as they help us find ours. In Orange, we broke free from the oppressive, normative communities of Amber. Now we have a chance to recreate community on new grounding, where we listen each other into selfhood and wholeness.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Location 1225-1234). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  ##### Wholeness with life and nature


  Paradoxically, again, the more we learn to be true to our unique self, the more it dawns on us that we are just one expression of something larger, an interconnected web of life and consciousness. That realization can be elating but also painful — we now comprehend how deeply our relationship with life and nature has been broken. We strive to repair that relationship, not from a place of moral obligation, but from an inner awareness, knowing that we are not separate from but one with nature. We see the foolishness and arrogance of mankind’s stance of putting itself above the rest of life and try to find a more truthful and humble place in the midst of it. Often, rekindling our relationship with life and nature causes us to pursue a simpler life, less cluttered by possessions we thought we needed until we understood that we are rich not through the things we own, but through the relationships that nourish our soul.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  #### Breakthroughs and characteristics of Teal organizations


  Like earlier organizational paradigms, Teal can be credited with bringing about certain fundamental breakthroughs in how humans collaborate:


  ##### Teal breakthrough 1: Self-Management


  Teal Organizations have found the key to operate effectively, even at a large scale, with a system based on peer relationships, without the need for either hierarchy or consensus. (See [Self-Management](../self-management/)).


  ##### Teal breakthrough 2: Wholeness


  Organizations have always been places that encourage people to show up with a narrow “professional” self and to check other parts of the self at the door. They often require us to show a masculine resolve, to display determination and strength, and to hide doubts and vulnerability. Rationality rules as king, while the emotional, intuitive, and spiritual parts of ourselves often feel unwelcome, out of place. Teal Organizations have developed a consistent set of practices that invite us to reclaim our inner wholeness and bring all of who we are to work. (See [Wholeness](../wholeness/)).


  ##### Teal breakthrough 3: Evolutionary Purpose


  Teal Organizations are seen as having a life and a sense of direction of their own. Instead of trying to predict and control the future, members of the organization are invited to listen in and understand what the organization wants to become, what purpose it wants to serve. (See [Evolutionary Purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/)).


  ##### Teal metaphor: organizations as living systems


  Teal organizations have a useful metaphor for the workplaces they aspire to create. Whereas Achievement-Orange speaks of organizations as machines and Pluralistic-Green uses the metaphor of families, Teal organizations refer to themselves as living organisms or living systems. Life, in all its evolutionary wisdom, manages ecosystems of unfathomable beauty, ever evolving toward more wholeness, complexity, and consciousness. Change in nature happens everywhere, all the time, in a self-organizing urge that comes from every cell and every organism, with no need for central command and control to give orders or pull the levers.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 1299-1303). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  ##### Teal organizations as "complex adaptive systems"


  An Evolutionary-Teal organization exhibits many properties of a [Complex Adaptive System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system) ^\[Complex adaptive systems are self-organizing systems that shows behavior which cannot be inferred from the behavior of their elements. Melanie Mitchell in Complexity, A Guided Tour, defines a complex adaptive system as "a system in which large networks of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing and adaptation via learning or evolution" (p13). Human beings are perfect examples of complex adaptive systems: The behavior of our brains, hands, feet, lungs, heart, etc., seen individually, does not indicate what our behavior will be. However, non-animate systems can also exhibit complex, adaptive behavior, for example the economy or a stock exchange. For a fuller discussion of organizations as complex adaptive systems, readers can refer to Margaret J. Wheatley, Leadership and the New Science, 3rd Ed., Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2006 and to Elizabeth McMillan, Complexity, Management and the Dynamics of Change, Routledge, 2008. Melanie Mitchell's Complexity, A Guided Tour (Oxford University Press, 2009) is also an excellent layman's introduction to the science of complex adaptive systems.]


  1. It has a purpose of its own, distinct from the purposes or objectives of its members, 

  2. It consists of a number of elements (members or teams),

  3. The elements interact, in a non-linear way, to achieve the purpose of the system,

  4. The interaction and relationships between elements are based on a few simple rules or guiding principles,

  5. The nature of the relationships and number of interactions between the elements result in emergent behavior - the behavior of the system is not the sum of the behaviors of the elements,

  6. The elements produce and use signals and information (sensing) from both external and internal environments and react accordingly,

  7. There is no central control,

  8. The elements self-organize, that is, change the relationships between themselves to adapt to changes in the environment,

  9. The elements learn from history, and from the environment, and adapt accordingly to ensure the survival of the system.


  Teal organizations are run by self-managing teams. These teams consists of workers who each fulfill certain roles, including functional and managerial duties. All decisions are made using a simple advice process and/or a conflict resolution process when appropriate. There is no centralized control. Values are no longer given perfunctory attention but are actually lived in how people behave in the organization. Everyone listens to the organization’s purpose and takes action accordingly while sensing for changes in the environment. Out of these collective actions, the behavior of the organization emerges.
