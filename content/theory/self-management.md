  ## 新视角


  一些先驱科学家认为，下一个世纪的主要科学领域将会是对复杂性、自催化，自我管理、非线性、以及适应性系统的研究。这通常被称为复杂体，或混沌学（对于蔚蓝阶段而言，这些理论等同于牛顿理论在橙色阶段的地位）。虽然我们目前还只是刚刚开始重视这些，但自我管理绝对并不是个惊人的新发明。这个世界已经按照这个规则运作了数十亿年，衍生出各种出色而复杂的，让我们几乎无法理解的生物体和生态系统（道）。自组织是这个世界的生命力量，在混沌的边缘维持恰到好处的用来旋卷能量的微量秩序，将秩序比例维持在刚好能生效而又不束缚灵活的适应性和学习创新进程，而生生不息。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 2997-3003). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  蔚蓝之前的所有意识阶段，都依赖于一种等级分化的权力结构，由特定的一些人行驶高于其他人的权威。力量和决策权集中在塔顶，将同事分割成有权和无权的强弱两种人群，并随之带来了有史以来一直在污染组织的各种扭曲和问题（违背人性）。组织内的权力被看作值得争夺的珍希商品。这种状况无疑会激发出人性的阴暗面：个人野心、政治心机、不信任、恐惧、和贪婪。在组织底层，这经常会激发带来无力感的两个孪生兄弟：懈怠和抱怨。我们在很多组织内见证到的那些不断蔓延开来的缺乏驱动力现象，就是权力不平等分配带来的毁灭性副作用。对少数幸运者而言，职场是快乐的自我表现空间，是一种跟同事友好携手追逐有意义目标的空间。而对多数人而言，工作单纯是种苦差，是每天出卖几个小时的人生来换取口粮的手段。全球化生产力的故事，只是个浪费才能和能量的悲伤神话。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 1416-1423). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.] ^\[A 2012 survey conducted by Tower Watson, a human resources consulting firm polled 32,000 workers in the corporate sector in 29 countries to measure employee engagement (as well as the key factors contributing to engagement, such as confidence in senior management and the perceived interest by senior management in employee well-being). The overarching conclusion: just around a third of people are engaged in their work (35 percent). Many more people are “detached” or actively “disengaged” (43 percent). The remaining 22 percent feel “unsupported.”] ^\[For a deep discussion of what motivates the modern worker, see Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us by Daniel Pink, Riverhead Hardcover, 2009.]


  之前阶段的组织都建造在一种貌似真实的共同假设基础上：不信任人们会在没有监督的情况下，自觉为了组织的最大利益而行动。蔚蓝组织则建立在一种双向信任的基础上。劳动者和员工被看作有理喻的个体，渴望进行卓越的工作（劳动成为第一需要的共产主义阶段），组织信任成员会做正确的事。有了这个前提，就只需要很少的规则和控制机制。成员得到赋能而创造奇迹。

  ## 实践中


  蔚蓝组织内的自我管理通过创新的结构＋程的组合运作来实现。这些会在此网站分别详述。这里给出一些亮点：


  #### 团队自治


  蔚蓝组织最常见的结构是由小型的自治团队组成的互相依赖的网络构造。这些网络的特征多种多样，随着组织的行业特点和环境而不同，但基本细胞都是团队，一般由10-20人组成，具有自组织特性，不存在任何团队外部的上司。


  #### 无上司或组织层级图


  蔚蓝组织内不存在固定的权力金字塔分层。团队内外都不存在上司。基本的上下级关系被平等同事为主的双向承诺关系替代。决策权和力量会流动到任何有专长、有兴趣，或有热情自愿走上前台，对某个场景做出贡献的成员那里。流动性的、自然形成的阶层，替代了传统金字塔等级的固定权力构造，于是组织不再需要组织结构图。参见[组织结构](../organizational-structure/)。


  #### 无固定的职称或工作描述


  蔚蓝组织内通常没有固定的职称或工作描述。每个人都兼任多个自己同意并自愿承诺完成的角色。当某人感觉到某个课题或机会在呼唤一个新角色，就会单纯的站出来，申请承担这个角色任务。参见职称和工作描述，以及岗位定义和任务分派。[职称与工作描述](../job-titles-and-job-descriptions/)以及[岗位定义与任务分派](../role-definition-and-allocation/)。


  #### 分布式决策机制


  蔚蓝的决策机制具有高度分散性。决策不需要被分级的指令系统批准，也不接受社区的监督。任何人都可以在寻求1）所有被影响到的人，2）在该领域有专长的人的建议之后做任何决策。参见[决策](../decision-making/)。


  #### 开放的信息流


  每个人都同时被赋予全部信息的访问权。参见[信息流](../information-flow/)。


  #### 冲突解决


  在同事之间意见不一致时，自行利用一种精确定义的冲突解决流程来解决。同事互相依赖，信任各自的双向承诺。参见 [冲突解决](../conflict-resolution/)。
faq:
  - question: Is there any evidence this actually works?
    answer: >-
      A 2009 Ernst & Young study found that Buurtzorg (see “Concrete examples
      for inspiration” below) requires, on average, close to 40 percent fewer
      hours of care per client than other nursing organizations— which is ironic
      when you consider that nurses in Buurtzorg take time for coffee and talk
      with the patients, their families, and neighbors, while other nursing
      organizations have come to time “products” in minutes. Patients stay in
      care only half as long,heal faster, and become more autonomous. A third of
      emergency hospital admissions are avoided, and when a patient does need to
      be admitted to the hospital, the average stay is shorter. The savings for
      the Dutch social security system are considerable— Ernst & Young estimates
      that close to € 2 billion would be saved in the Netherlands every year if
      all home care organizations achieved Buurtzorg’s results. Scaled to the US
      population, this savings would be equivalent to roughly $ 49
      billion^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide
      to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human
      Consciousness (Kindle Locations 1521-1527). Nelson Parker. Kindle
      Edition.]


      In the case of FAVI (see “Concrete examples for inspiration” below), a foundry based in France, all its competitors have moved to China to enjoy cheaper labor costs. And yet FAVI is not only the one producer left standing in Europe; it also commands a 50 percent market share for its gearbox forks. Its product quality is legendary, and its on-time delivery close to mythical: workers are proud of their record of not a single order delivered late in over 25 years. FAVI delivers high profit margins, year in and year out, despite Chinese competition, salaries well above average, and highly cyclical demand patterns.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 1690-1694). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]
  - question: Isn’t this the same as “empowerment”?
    answer: "Pluralistic-Green organizations seek to deal with the problem of power
      inequality through empowerment, pushing decisions down the pyramid, and
      they often achieve much higher employee engagement. But empowerment within
      the traditional hierarchy means that someone at the top must be wise or
      noble enough to give away some of his power, and those below are subject
      to that power being reclaimed.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing
      Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next
      Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 1431-1433). Nelson Parker.
      Kindle Edition.]"
  - question: Does this mean that everyone is equal?
    answer: >-
      In Teal Organizations: the point is not to make everyone equal; it is to
      allow all employees to grow into the strongest, healthiest version of
      themselves. Gone is the dominator hierarchy (the structure where bosses
      hold power over their subordinates). And precisely for that reason, lots
      of natural, evolving, overlapping hierarchies can emerge— hierarchies of
      development, skill, talent, expertise, and recognition, for example. This
      is a point that management author Gary Hamel noted about Morning
      Star:^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide
      to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human
      Consciousness (Kindle Locations 3050-3058). Nelson Parker. Kindle
      Edition.]


      *Morning Star is a collection of naturally dynamic hierarchies. There isn’t one formal hierarchy; there are many informal ones. On any issue some colleagues will have a bigger say than others will, depending on their expertise and willingness to help. These are hierarchies of influence, not position, and they’re built from the bottom up. At Morning Star one accumulates authority by demonstrating expertise, helping peers, and adding value. Stop doing those things, and your influence wanes— as will your pay.*^\[Gary Hamel, “First, Let’s Fire All the Managers,” Harvard Business Review, December 2011, http:// hbr.org/ 2011/ 12/ first-lets-fire-all-the-managers, accessed April 11, 2012.]
