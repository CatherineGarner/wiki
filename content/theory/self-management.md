  ## 新视角


  一些先驱科学家认为，下一个世纪的主要科学领域将会是对复杂性、自催化，自我管理、非线性、以及适应性系统的研究。这通常被称为复杂体，或混沌学（对于蔚蓝阶段而言，这些理论等同于牛顿理论在橙色阶段的地位）。虽然我们目前还只是刚刚开始重视这些，但自我管理绝对并不是个惊人的新发明。这个世界已经按照这个规则运作了数十亿年，衍生出各种出色而复杂的，让我们几乎无法理解的生物体和生态系统（道）。自组织是这个世界的生命力量，在混沌的边缘维持恰到好处的用来旋卷能量的微量秩序，将秩序比例维持在刚好能生效而又不束缚灵活的适应性和学习创新进程，而生生不息。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  蔚蓝之前的所有意识阶段，都依赖于一种等级分化的权力结构，由特定的一些人行驶高于其他人的权威。力量和决策权集中在塔顶，将同事分割成有权和无权的强弱两种人群，并随之带来了有史以来一直在污染组织的各种扭曲和问题（违背人性）。组织内的权力被看作值得争夺的珍希商品。这种状况无疑会激发出人性的阴暗面：个人野心、政治心机、不信任、恐惧、和贪婪。在组织底层，这经常会激发带来无力感的两个孪生兄弟：懈怠和抱怨。我们在很多组织内见证到的那些不断蔓延开来的缺乏驱动力现象，就是权力不平等分配带来的毁灭性副作用。对少数幸运者而言，职场是快乐的自我表现空间，是一种跟同事友好携手追逐有意义目标的空间。而对多数人而言，工作单纯是种苦差，是每天出卖几个小时的人生来换取口粮的手段。全球化生产力的故事，只是个浪费才能和能量的悲伤神话。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

The overarching conclusion: just around a third of people are engaged in their work (35 percent). Many more people are “detached” or actively “disengaged” (43 percent). The remaining 22 percent feel “unsupported.”] ^\[For a deep discussion of what motivates the modern worker, see Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us by Daniel Pink, Riverhead Hardcover, 2009.]


  Earlier stage organizations are seemingly built on the assumption that people cannot be trusted to act in the organization’s best interest without supervision. Teal Organizations are built on a foundation of mutual trust. Workers and employees are seen as reasonable people that want to do good work and can be trusted to do the right thing. With that premise, very few rules and control mechanisms are needed. And employees are energized to make extraordinary things happen.

  Self-management in Teal comes about through a combination of innovative
  structures and processes. These are described in detail throughout the wiki,
  but a few are highlighted below:


  #### Autonomous teams


  The most common structure of Teal organizations are interdependent networks of small, autonomous teams. The nature of these networks will take a variety of forms, depending on the characteristics of their industry and environment, but all consist primarily of teams, usually 10-20 people, that self-organize and are not under the authority of anyone outside the team.


  #### No bosses or organization chart


  There are no fixed hierarchies of authority in Teal organizations. There are no bosses within or outside of the teams. The primacy of the boss-subordinate relationship is replaced with peer-based mutual commitments. Decision rights and power flow to any individual who has the expertise, interest, or willingness to step in and contribute to a situation. Fluid, natural hierarchies replace the fixed power hierarchies of the traditional pyramid - leaving the organization without an organizational chart. See also [Organizational Structure](../organizational-structure/).


  #### No job descriptions or job titles


  There are typically no job descriptions or job titles in Teal organizations. Rather each individual has a number of roles that he/she has agreed to and committed to fulfill. When someone senses an issue or an opportunity that calls for a new role, someone simply steps forward and offers to take on that role. See also [Job Titles and Job Descriptions](../job-titles-and-job-descriptions/) and [Role Definition and Allocation](../role-definition-and-allocation/).


  #### Distributed decision-making


  Decision-making is highly distributed. Decisions do not need to be validated by the hierarchy nor by consensus of the community. Any person can make any decision after seeking advice from 1) everyone who will be meaningfully affected, and 2) people with expertise in the matter. See also [Decision Making](../decision-making/).


  #### Open Information flow


  Everybody is given access to all information at the same time. See also [Information Flow](../information-flow/).


  #### Conflict resolution


  Disagreements are resolved among peers using a well defined conflict resolution process. Peers hold each other accountable for their mutual commitments. See also [Conflict Resolution](../conflict-resolution/).

  - question: Is there any evidence this actually works?
    answer: >-
      A 2009 Ernst & Young study found that Buurtzorg (see “Concrete examples
      for inspiration” below) requires, on average, close to 40 percent fewer
      hours of care per client than other nursing organizations— which is ironic
      when you consider that nurses in Buurtzorg take time for coffee and talk
      with the patients, their families, and neighbors, while other nursing
      organizations have come to time “products” in minutes. Patients stay in
      care only half as long,heal faster, and become more autonomous. A third of
      emergency hospital admissions are avoided, and when a patient does need to
      be admitted to the hospital, the average stay is shorter. The savings for
      the Dutch social security system are considerable— Ernst & Young estimates
      that close to € 2 billion would be saved in the Netherlands every year if
      all home care organizations achieved Buurtzorg’s results. Scaled to the US
      population, this savings would be equivalent to roughly $ 49
      billion^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide

      Consciousness (Kindle Locations 1521-1527). Nelson Parker. Kindle
      Edition.]


      In the case of FAVI (see “Concrete examples for inspiration” below), a foundry based in France, all its competitors have moved to China to enjoy cheaper labor costs. And yet FAVI is not only the one producer left standing in Europe; it also commands a 50 percent market share for its gearbox forks. Its product quality is legendary, and its on-time delivery close to mythical: workers are proud of their record of not a single order delivered late in over 25 years. FAVI delivers high profit margins, year in and year out, despite Chinese competition, salaries well above average, and highly cyclical demand patterns.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  - question: Isn’t this the same as “empowerment”?
    answer: "Pluralistic-Green organizations seek to deal with the problem of power
      inequality through empowerment, pushing decisions down the pyramid, and
      they often achieve much higher employee engagement. But empowerment within
      the traditional hierarchy means that someone at the top must be wise or
      noble enough to give away some of his power, and those below are subject
      to that power being reclaimed.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing
      Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next
      Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 1431-1433). Nelson Parker.
      Kindle Edition.]"
  - question: Does this mean that everyone is equal?
    answer: >-
      In Teal Organizations: the point is not to make everyone equal; it is to
      allow all employees to grow into the strongest, healthiest version of
      themselves. Gone is the dominator hierarchy (the structure where bosses
      hold power over their subordinates). And precisely for that reason, lots
      of natural, evolving, overlapping hierarchies can emerge— hierarchies of
      development, skill, talent, expertise, and recognition, for example. This
      is a point that management author Gary Hamel noted about Morning
      Star:^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide
      to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human
      Consciousness (Kindle Locations 3050-3058). Nelson Parker. Kindle
      Edition.]


      *Morning Star is a collection of naturally dynamic hierarchies. There isn’t one formal hierarchy; there are many informal ones. On any issue some colleagues will have a bigger say than others will, depending on their expertise and willingness to help. These are hierarchies of influence, not position, and they’re built from the bottom up. At Morning Star one accumulates authority by demonstrating expertise, helping peers, and adding value. Stop doing those things, and your influence wanes— as will your pay.*^\[Gary Hamel, “First, Let’s Fire All the Managers,” Harvard Business Review, December 2011, http:// hbr.org/ 2011/ 12/ first-lets-fire-all-the-managers, accessed April 11, 2012.]
