  此主题讨论由谁以及如何在组织内做出决策。在蔚蓝组织中，决策权真正的分布在整个组织中。

  ![](/media/decision.jpg)
perspective: >-
  在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，决策权高度下放而分散。一线个人或团队有机会做出影响自己工作的决策。尽管决策可能不需要经过等级制度或共识的批准，但还是让专家和受影响的人都参与决策。


  组织在每一个历史阶段都产生了不同的决策视角和截然不同的实践。在早期组织中，有些是高层做出决策。但现代的一些传统组织也已经开始有意识地试图“授权”给底层成员。


  #### 红色组织


  在[红色模式](../red-organizations/)中，任何后果的决定都由老板/主管做出。员工的行动必须征得老板的同意，否则将面临严重后果。红色组织的执行效率源于人性恐惧带来的控制，这降低了成员做出自主决策的意愿。


  #### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀模式](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，决策权大小根据个人在等级制度中的地位决定。最重要的不是创新，而是遵循标准操作程序。正式流程支持下的清晰指挥链定义了谁可以做什么。个人都应该接受这些流程和传统。


  #### 橙色组织


  [橙色模式](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)认为组织是需要“调整”才能提高效率的机器。由高层管理者宣布总体方向或战略，然后目标逐级下达。中层管理者根据自己的任务目标，制定计划并寻求批准。这些计划引导着决策朝着实现目标（例如利润和市场份额）的方向发展。也会邀请团队成员提出建议并参与决策过程。目的是鼓励创新和辩论。组织的首要目标是保障可预测性和可控制性。


  #### 绿色组织


  价值观驱动、目标导向的[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)的目标是致力于为多个利益相关者服务。例如，为了服务客户以及更广泛的利益相关者群体，通常鼓励一线员工在没有上级批准的情况下做出重大决策。因他们与日常事务保持着紧密联系，所以被相信有能力思考出比“专家”更好的解决方案，因专家可能脱离基层。组织的重点是保持一种强大的，通常是“家庭”式的文化。高度重视共识。


  #### 蔚蓝组织


  在进化主题的蔚蓝组织中，决策的标准从外部转移到内部。人们关心的是人性的内在力量和正义感：这个决定感觉是正确的吗？我对自己足够真诚吗？这符合我的感觉吗？我是在为世界服务吗？因降低了自我恐惧，人们能够有勇气做出看似危险的决定。虽然没有缜密权衡过所有可能的结果，但这个决定与内心深处的信念产生了共鸣。人们会对那些感觉不太对劲的情况，或者呼唤自己直言不讳并采取行动的情况产生敏感反应，即使面对反对或看似成功概率很低也会决定行动（内在创造力，创新前提）。这是出于一种正直和真实感。

  ### The advice process


  几乎所有的[ 蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)都以某种形式采用了早期先锋 ([AES](http://www.aes.com/)) 最早提出的“建议流程”。


  此流程有很多种形式，但本质是一致的：任何人都可以在征求 1）所有会受到有直接或深度影响的人，以及2）在这件事上有专长者的建议后，作出任何决定。


  所收到的建议必须得到考虑。问题的关键不在于找到一个能满足每个人愿望的折衷方案。而是为了获取集体智慧以寻求一个合理的决定。决策者根据收到的所有建议和观点，做出选择确定一个自己认为最好的行动方案。


  建议终归是建议。无论建议者是何等重要的人物，都无权能告诉（或强迫）决策者该做什么决定。通常，决策者是最先注意到该问题的人，或者是受其影响最大的人。


  很多组织的实践已经证明此流程非常有效。这为每个人提供了掌握权力的机会。权力不再是一个零和游戏。通过建议流程，在集体智慧支撑下每个人都变得强大起来。


  #### 建议并非共识


  我们通常以为，决策只有两种方式：要么由有权有势的人（有人说了算，这可能让有些人感到沮丧；但至少事情会完成），要么是一致同意（每个人都有发言权，但决策速度可能慢得令人沮丧）。


  对于自我管理组织的决策，存在着一种误解，认为决策都是通过全体都同意，甚至让每个人都参与决策过程来完成。事实上，寻求建议者虽然必须考虑所有相关的建议，但仍然可以做出自己的决定。


  全体共识可能听起来很有吸引力，但赋予每个人否决权，有时候导致决策效率很低。但在建议流程中，权力和责任都在于决策者。因此，避免了造成低效的阻挡力量。


  问题的所有权清楚地掌握在一个人身上：决策者。他/她确信自己做了最好的决定，能满怀热情地把事情做好或管理好，并能为任何错误承担责任。


  因此，建议流程超越了自上而下和基于共识这两种传统的决策方式。


  #### 建议流程的益处


  建议流程让自我管理得以蓬勃发展。在AES公司首次引入了这种做法的Dennis Bakke（他写了两本书）指出这个流程的主要优势：有助于打造社区、培育谦逊、有助于学习成长和更好的决策，又很开心。


  * **社区**: 就手头课题寻求人们的建议，能吸引人们的关注。让人们通过这个问题得到学习机会。信息共享加强了社区感觉。被征求意见的人感到荣幸和被需要。

  * **谦卑**: 征求意见是一种谦虚的行为，这是一个愉快职场最重要的特征之一。单是行为本身就在说“我需要你”。决策者和咨询顾问之间的关系会越来越密切。这让决策者几乎不可能忽视某个建议。

  * **学习**: 决策过程是一种在职教育。建议来自于了解情况并关心结果的人。没有其他形式的教练或培训能与这种实时体验相媲美。

  * **优质决策**: 与传统的自上而下的方法相比，这个做法得出最佳决策的机会更大。决策者的优势是更接近问题，并且必须对决策的后果承担责任。而建议内容能提供不同的输入，揭示重要问题和新的观点。

  * **乐趣**: 这个过程对决策者而言很有趣，因为这很类似于玩团队游戏。建议流程激发了主动性和创造性，而这些素质又会通过组织中其他知识渊博者的智慧而得以强化。


  #### Steps in the advice process


  There are a number of steps in the advice process:


  * Someone notices a problem or opportunity and takes the initiative, or alerts someone better placed to do so.

  * Prior to a proposal, the decision-maker may seek input to sound out perspectives before proposing action. 

  * The initiator makes a proposal and seeks advice from those affected or those with expertise. 

  * Taking this advice into account, the decision-maker decides on an action and informs those who have given advice.


  #### Forms the advice process can take


  Because the advice process involves taking advice from those affected by a decision, it naturally follows that the bigger the decision, the wider the net needs to be cast - including, if these roles exist, the CEO or board.


  For minor decisions, there may be no need to seek advice. For larger decisions, advice can come through various channels, including one-on-one conversations, meetings, or online communication. 


  Some organizations have specific types of meetings to support the advice process, or follow formal methods. (See Buurtzorg and Holacracy below). Some organizations choose to have circles made up of representative colleagues who go through the advice process on behalf of the whole organization.


  When decisions affect large numbers, or people who cannot meet physically, the process can happen via the internet.


  * The decision-maker can post a proposal on the company blog and call for comments or invite email responses and then process the advice they receive.

  * The organization can use decision-making software like [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/), a free and open-source tool. The process for using the advice process on [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/): start a discussion to frame the topic and gather input, host a proposal so everyone affected by the issue can voice their position, and then the final decision-maker specifies the outcome (automatically notifying the whole group).


  #### Underlying mindsets and training


  The advice process is a tool that helps decision-making via collective intelligence. Much depends on the spirit in which people approach it. When the advice process is introduced, it might be worthwhile to train colleagues not only in the mechanics but also on the mindset underlying effective use.


  The advice process can proceed in several ways, depending on the mindset people bring to it:


  * The initiator can approach it authoritatively ("I don't care about what others have said" or, alternatively, "I fully comply with what others - someone highly respected, or the majority - have said").

  * They can approach from a perspective of negotiation or compromise ("I'll do some of what they say so they're happy, but it will increment my frustration account by 1").

  * They can approach it co-creatively, which is the spirit of the advice process ("I will listen to others, understand the real need in what they say, and think creatively about an elegant solution").


  #### Role modeling


  When the advice process is first introduced, the founder and/or CEO need to be role-models. Power is initially held by organizational leaders, and it doesn't get distributed by magic - [successfully distributing leadership requires careful, proactive effort](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/how-to-grow-distributed-leadership-7f6b25f0361c). By role modeling, others will take cues from their behavior.  


  Role modeling can take several forms: 


  * When you want to make a decision, pause and ask: Am I the best person for this decision? (That is, the person most closely linked to the decision, or the person with most energy, skill, and experience to make it?). If not, ask the person you think is better placed to take the initiative. If he/she doesn't want to, you might be best placed after all.

  * If you are the right person to make a decision, identify those from whom you should seek advice. Approach them and explain what you are doing. ("I'm playing by the advice process. Here is an opportunity I see. This is the decision I propose to take. Can you give me your advice?"). You can also share who else you are asking for advice. Once you've received advice and made your decision, inform those you consulted (and anyone else who should know).

  * When colleagues ask you to make a decision ("What should I do?"), instead ask them "What is your proposed decision?". In the same vein, state clearly that you no longer give approval for decisions. Instead, share your advice and suggest who else to ask. Remind them the decision is theirs.


  For many leaders, unlearning the habit of making all the decisions is hard. It requires commitment and mindfulness. If you find yourself falling into the old pattern, take the opportunity to acknowledge your mistake, and restate the importance of the process. This can turn a mistake into a powerful learning moment. Better habits are formed through repeated practice.


  ### Consent-based decision making


  A variation of the advice process is consent-based decision making. "Consent" is different from "consensus" in the sense of unanimity. The consent principle says that a decision can be made as long as no one has a reasoned, substantial objection (also known as a "block"). Consent doesn't mean everyone loves the decision, but that they can live with it. 


  In practice, consent means that if one person raises a principled objection, the decision is blocked. The proposer must pause and, together with the objector, devise a solution that overcomes the objection. A block in a consensus process is a signal to the whole team to "swarm" to understand the objection and problem solve.


  Giving such power to a principled objection can be both valuable and dangerous. Valuable because sometimes a single person senses something important that no one else sees. On the other hand, such power can be abused if people block decisions for reasons other than purpose. Groups that use consent-based decision-making often take blocking and shared understanding about policies and culture around blocking very seriously for this reason. (For a real-world example, see the [Enspiral Decision Agreement](https://handbook.enspiral.com/decisions_agreement.html)).


  Some methods, like Holacracy, deem an objection valid only if the argument passes stringent tests, such as it makes matters worse. A colleague cannot block a proposal simply because he or she thinks they have a better proposal, or because they don't love an idea.


  (for a description of Consent Based Decision, see[ https://thedecider.app/consent-decision-making](https://thedecider.app/consent-decision-making))


  #### The advice process within a hierarchy


  Some organizations want to move toward self-management, but cannot move away from hierarchy completely. Others, especially large organizations, prefer to adopt interim steps. This can be part of a transition to self-management.  


  AES, the 40,000 employee company where the term "advice process' was coined, operated with remnants of a hierarchy. Anyone could initiate the process, but it was mandatory to consult certain categories of colleagues. These might include one's superiors, or even the board.


  #### Sources that inform decision-making


  Teal organizations tend to take a broad range of sources into account:


  * **Rationality**: Many think that rationality rules, and is the legitimate basis for decision-making. Teal considers rational, analytical approaches to be critical, but not the only source to inform decision making.

  * **Emotions**: Whereas the modern-scientific perspective is wary of emotions, Teal recognizes that wisdom is to be found there when we learn to inquire into their significance: "Why am I angry, fearful, ambitious, or excited? What does this reveal about me or about the situation that is unfolding?"

  * **Intuition**: Wisdom can be found in intuition, too. Intuition honors the ambiguous, paradoxical, non-linear nature of reality. We unconsciously connect patterns in ways that our rational mind cannot. Many great minds, like Einstein, had a deep reverence for intuition. They claim it is a muscle that can be trained. Learning to pay attention to intuitions, to question them for guidance, allows intuitive answers to surface.

  * **Paradoxical thinking**: A Teal breakthrough is the ability to live with paradox; beyond "either-or" to "both-and" thinking. Breathing in and breathing out illustrates the difference. Either-or thinking sees them as opposites. Both-and thinking sees them as needing each other. The more we can breathe in, the more we can breathe out. One such paradox is the advice process: it is a decision-making process that at once encourages individual initiative and the voice of the collective. It's both-and.

  An Introduction to the Advice Process, with a video of Frédéric Laloux on this topic

  <http://dev.alchemi.co.uk/adviceprocess/#/page/5cf823717fb0de42f3aeddfc>
faq:
  - question: What prevents people from simply not requesting or ignoring advice?
    answer: >-
      Colleagues know that using the advice process isn't optional. One way to
      be dismissed is to ignore the mutual obligations of the advice process.
      With a [conflict resolution process](../conflict-resolution/) (as in some
      Teal entities) someone who feels the advice process is not being respected
      can hold a colleague to account. 


      But when people get used to it, respect for the practice grows. This because people are on both sides of the equation. When you ask me for my advice this morning, I hope you will take it seriously. If our roles are reversed this afternoon, I need to take you seriously, too. Because power is distributed, you know that others can take decisions about things you care about as well, so you are apt to take their needs and views into account.
  - question: Who decides who gets to be the decision maker?
    answer: "Put another way: Who can decide who makes what decisions, while still
      using the advice process? \r

      \r

      In practice, initiating advice and decision making usually fits
      within in the scope of a certain role. Someone sensing a problem or an
      opportunity could step forward to say: \"Hey, I see this opportunity. What
      do you think? Given your role should you initiate this?\". However, if
      that person doesn't have the interest or bandwidth to lead the process,
      any other person can. If no one does, it usually means the decision is not
      that important right now. \r

      \r

      Holacracy adds a twist: for particularly sensitive areas, a
      \"domain\" can be declared. A domain basically means \"hands-off\".
      Decisions relating to that domain can only be made by nominated person(s).
      The idea is that domains remain exceptional and shouldn't be used
      frequently. "
  - question: If we accept that an organization has its own sense of direction, how
      do we find out where it wants to go?
    answer: >-
      #### Sensing as a natural outcome of self-management


      The simplest answer is often: Do nothing special. Let self-management work its magic. One word often comes up with Teal pioneers: *Sensing*. We notice when something isn’t working as it should, or could. With experience, our capacity to sense grows. 


      #### The Empty Chair


      One practice to keep purpose foremost is to allocate an empty chair at meetings to represent our [evolutionary purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/). Anybody can occupy the seat and represent the voice of the organization. Different questions can arise from this perspective: Have today's discussions and decisions served you (the organization) well? What stands out to you from today’s meeting? Are we being bold enough? Too bold? Is there anything else that needs to be discussed?


      #### Large Group Processes


      When facing a major inflection, some more elaborate processes help. These include Otto Scharmer’s “[Theory U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-procedure_and_Theory_U)”, David Cooperrider’s “[Appreciative Inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appreciative_inquiry)", Marvin Weisbord and Sandra Janoff’s “[Future Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Search)",  Harrison Owen’s “[Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology), [Art of Hosting](http://www.artofhosting.org/), [World Café](http://www.theworldcafe.com/), etc. ”
  - question: Can this type of decision-making be upheld in a time of crisis?
    answer: >-
      In crises, time is of the essence. Is the advice process too unwieldy?


      There are good examples of organizations that have used the advice process during crises. Rarely are decisions so urgent that a few hours can't be found to seek advice. And if possible, a crisis makes it even more important that a 'right' decision is made. 


      If, for some reason, the process does need to be suspended, two guidelines maintain trust in[ self-management:](../self-management/) Full transparency about the scope and time frame of the crisis response, and making sure such powers clearly cease when the crisis is over.


      In fact in many ways, the advice process allows for even faster and more decisive action, because many people in the organization practice being empowered decision-makers on a regular basis. In a well-functioning Teal organization, someone who is aware of a crises will weigh the advice it's feasible to get in the time they have, and make a judgement call.
  - question: What about decisions that affect the whole organization? Isn’t it
      impractical to solicit feedback from large numbers?
    answer: >-
      When decisions affect the whole organization, it is particularly important
      to make the right decision. Yet, in very large organizations, the decision
      maker can hardly meet with everyone.


      Some use internal social networks, or decision-making tools like [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/), for wide and swift consultation. The initiator puts the proposal up as a post. Colleagues offer advice by responding on-line. If their comments signal agreement, the decision can be made very quickly. If new perspectives and debate emerge, the decision maker can choose to amend his proposal and float it again. If it appears decision time is not yet ripe, a working group may be set up.
  - question: Is there no room for centralized planning? Aren’t we losing something
      important here?
    answer: >-
      Predictions offer a comforting sense of control, but reality is that
      organizations and the world they exist in are complex. In such systems, it
      is meaningless to predict the future with great confidence. 


      [Teal Organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) accept a complex world in which perfection is elusive. They don't aim for perfection, but for workable solutions that arise from current reality, and which can be implemented quickly.


      If there is a workable solution on the table (“workable” = the solution won't make things worse), it will be adopted.  Decisions are not postponed because someone thinks more analysis will produce a better decision. The decision can be reviewed at any time. This is the essence of a culture of continuous iterative improvement.


      Brian Robertson from [Holacracy ](http://www.holacracy.org/)uses a powerful metaphor to contrast the two approaches:


      > “Imagine if we rode a bicycle like we try to manage our companies today. It would look something like this: we’d have our big committee meeting, where we all plan how to best steer the bicycle. We’d fearfully look at the road up ahead, trying to predict exactly where the bicycle is going to be when. … We’d make our plans, we’d have our project managers, we’d have our Gantt charts, we’d put in place our controls to make sure this all goes according to plan. Then we get on the bicycle, we close our eyes, we hold the handle bar rigidly at the angle we calculated up front and we try to steer according to plan. And if the bicycle falls over somewhere along the way ... well, first: who is to blame? Let’s find them, fire them, get them out of here. And then: we know what to do differently next time. We obviously missed something. We need more upfront prediction. We need more controls to make sure things go according to plan.”


      In the Teal paradigm, the rider gets on the bike, starts with an angle that seems about right, and then keeps adjusting to get to the destination. Companies working this way often progress faster, and more smoothly toward their purpose, with less wasted energy.
  - question: Does decision-making in Teal organizations require multiple bottom
      line accounting systems?
    answer: "Among Teal management practices, multiple bottom line accounting
      systems are rare. There is a school of thought that suggests we need ways
      to track not just profit, but also the firm’s impact on people and planet.
      How else can managers make trade-offs between these elements?  \r

      \r

      Perhaps the answer lies elsewhere: Multiple bottom lines originated
      to avoid a narrow fixation on profits. From a Teal perspective, a wider
      perspective already exists. Purpose, integrity and wholeness should
      transcend the primacy of profits.  "
