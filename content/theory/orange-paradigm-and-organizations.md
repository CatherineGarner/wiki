  橙色组织代表了科学和工业革命的进步。这个意识阶段认为世界是一台复杂的机器，其内部工作原理和自然规律都可以被研究和理解。这一观点在过去两个世纪深刻地改变了人类，带来了前所未有的繁荣和生命的希望。当今的管理思路特点是注重竞争、创新和绩效，这些塑造了橙色组织的运作方式。领导从指挥和控制转变为预测和控制（目标管理）。作为机器的组织是橙色世界观的主要隐喻。现在大多数大公司都是这样运作的。

  #### 橙色意识阶段


  从橙色意识角度来看，世界不再被视为一个由固定规则支配的僵化宇宙；而是被视为一台复杂的机器，其内部工作原理和自然规律可以被研究和理解。


  如果我在理解和操纵这台机器（世界）方面比别人更快、更聪明、更具创新性，那么我将获得更多的成功、财富、市场份额或任何我想要的东西。


  儿童心理学家皮亚杰给我们做了一个关于橙色认知思维的定义性实验：


  * 给一个人三杯透明的液体，并告诉他们，可以通过特定的配合混合方式，产生黄色。

  * 那些思想还没有达到橙色阶段的人只会随意地把液体混合在一起。

  * 那些认知水平进入橙色的人，首先会形成一个大致的印象，知道需要轮流尝试混合玻璃杯A和B，然后A和C，然后B和C，以此类推。他们会一次一个地尝试所有不同的组合。


  这意味着人们有能力开始想象不同次元的世界。“如果”和“好像”第一次变得可掌握。于是打开了通向各种理想的可能性。有了这种认知能力，人们就可以质疑权威、群体规范和所继承的现状。橙色认知打开了科学研究、创新和创业的闸门。


  这个阶段的世界观是绝对的唯物主义，认为只有看得见摸得着的才真实。橙色的世界观怀疑任何形式的灵性和超越性，因为橙色意识难以相信一些无法通过经验证明或观察到的事物。在这个唯物的世界里，什么都是多多益善（贪婪）。


  #### 橙色发展阶段的阴暗面


  Every paradigm, seen from a more advanced stage, has its shadows. The dark side of the Orange paradigm is hard to ignore: corporate greed, political short-termism, over leverage, over-consumption, and the reckless exploitation of the planet’s resources and ecosystems.


  Another  shadow is “innovation gone mad.” With most of our basic needs taken care of, businesses increasingly try to create needs, feeding the illusion that more stuff will make us happy and whole.


  A further shadow appears when success is measured solely in terms of money and recognition. When growth and the bottom line are all that count, and when the only successful life is one that reaches the top, people often experience a sense of emptiness in their lives.


  However, these shouldn’t eclipse the liberation this stage has brought. Making it OK to question authority has allowed us to engage, for the first time, in the pursuit of truth regardless of religious dogma or political authority. We have become capable of questioning and stepping out of the condition we were born into; we are capable of breaking free from the thoughts and behaviors that gender and our social class would have imposed upon us in earlier times.


  #### Breakthroughs and characteristics of Orange organizations


  Street gangs and mafias are contemporary examples of Red Organizations. The Catholic Church, the military, and the public school system are archetypes of Amber Organizations. Modern global corporations are the embodiment of Orange Organizations. In terms of outcome, Amber Organizations surpassed anything Red Organizations could even contemplate.


  Orange Organizations ratcheted this up another level, achieving results on entirely new orders of magnitude, thanks to three additional breakthroughs: innovation, accountability, and meritocracy.


  ##### Orange breakthrough 1: Innovation


  People operating from the Orange paradigm can live in a world of possibilities; what is not yet, could be one day. They can question the status quo and formulate ways to improve it. Unsurprisingly, leaders of Orange Organizations don’t tire of saying that change and innovation are not threats, but opportunities. Orange Organizations retain a hierarchical pyramid, but create departments such as R&D , Marketing and Product Management to foster and enable innovation. Project and cross–functional teams come together to look at problems and issues in new ways.


  ##### Orange breakthrough 2: Accountability


  A subtle but profound change takes place in leadership and management style. Amber command and control becomes Orange predict and control. In order to innovate more often and faster than others, it becomes a competitive advantage to tap into the intelligence of many brains in the organization. More people in the organization are given room to maneuver and are empowered and trusted to think and make decisions.


  Orange Organizations have invented a host of incentive processes to motivate employees to reach the targets that have been set, including performance appraisals, bonus schemes, quality awards, and stock options. To put it simply, where Amber relied on sticks, Orange came up with carrots.


  The breakthrough in terms of freedom is real. Managers and employees are given room to exercise their creativity and talent and the latitude to figure out how they want to reach their objectives. In practice fear of failure often drives managers to keep control rather than delegating, thus losing the benefits of distributing responsibility.


  ##### Orange breakthrough 3: Meritocracy


  Orange Organizations have adopted the radical idea of meritocracy. In principle, anybody can move up the ladder, and nobody has to be confined to their position. The mailroom boy can become the CEO―even if that boy happens to be a girl or has a minority background. Orange has given birth to modern human resources and a range of processes and practices, including performance appraisal, incentive systems, resource planning, talent management, leadership training, and succession planning.


  It is hard to overstate the historical significance of the idea of meritocracy. People now take responsibility for managing their careers and expect to change positions every few years, either inside the organization, or outside if needed.


  Identity is no longer fused with rank and title; instead it is synonymous  with our need to be seen as competent, successful and ready for the next promotion.


  ##### Orange metaphor: organizations as machines


  Orange thinking sees organizations as machines. The engineering jargon we use to talk about organizations reveals how deeply we hold this metaphor. We talk about units and layers, inputs and outputs, efficiency and effectiveness, pulling the lever and moving the needle, accelerating and hitting the brakes, scoping problems and scaling solutions, information flows and bottlenecks, re-engineering and downsizing.


  Leaders and consultants design organizations. Humans are resources that must be carefully aligned on the chart, rather like cogs in a machine. Changes must be planned and mapped out in blueprints, then carefully implemented according to plan. If some of the machinery functions below the expected rhythm, it’s probably time for a “soft” intervention―the occasional team-building―like injecting oil to grease the wheels.


  The machine metaphor also reveals the dynamic nature of organizations in Orange (as compared to Amber, where we think of organizations as rigid, unchanging sets of rules and hierarchies). There is room for energy, creativity, and innovation. At the same time, the metaphor of the machine indicates that these organizations, however much they brim with activity, can still feel lifeless and soulless.
