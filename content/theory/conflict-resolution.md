  冲突解决是蔚蓝组织体系内的一个至关重要的板块。如果没有上司充当解决纠纷的中介，就需要开发一种新流程来处理冲突。在蔚蓝组织内，冲突解决基于同事连带感的人际关系。如果不努力打造良好的人际关系，就会发现这个流程很难奏效，或根本无效。


  多数蔚蓝组织都以人性的某些基本假设为运作依据：员工都是很有思想，值得信赖的成熟人格，有能力并可靠，能对自己的决策和行为负责。在一个以这些蔚蓝假设为依据的职场内，清晰定义好的冲突解决流程，配合良好的实施培训，能给成员提供一套途径和技巧，用于淡定而优雅的处理不一致见解。


  不同的组织历程阶段，产生了对冲突的不同见解和解决方案，以及实践方式：


  #### **红色组织**


  在[红色模式](../red-organizations/)中，老板或领导者主要是通过行使权力来迫使他人保持一致性。恐惧是组织的粘合剂。一般来说，冲突是通过镇压、权力或统治来处理的，通过制定严格的规则以及惩罚的恐惧来强化权力。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  [琥珀模式](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)在一个层级金字塔结构和自上而下的命令和控制（什么和如何）体系中，对角色进行正规定义。首先重视稳定性，并致力于通过明确定义的角色和流程来维持稳定。



  管理冲突的方法是回避或抑制。掌权者独裁的制定规则，并通常通过律法性行为保障执行。这个类型的组织通常制定强大的人力资源流程，用来管理成员和雇主之间的冲突和不满。


  #### **橙色组织**


  在[橙色模式](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/), 中，虽依然存在着层级结构，但开始采用面向目标的管理（只定义什么；在如何做角度给部下更多的自由）。在许多橙色组织中，虽然有正式的冲突解决程序，但冲突往往得不到良好解决。虽然经常鼓励成员自己去解决分歧，但事实上冲突往往需要通过第三方的干预来解决。一般通过将问题提交给上司，或遵循人力资源规则和流程来完成。这些解决程序一般能给出一定程度上的、中立于冲突双方的第三方客观见解。


  #### **绿色组织**


  [绿色模式](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)依然使用经典的金字塔结构，但更注重授权。绿色组织有基于价值观的文化，包括正直、尊重和开放等原则。在促进合作、沟通、解决问题和起草满足基本需求的协议方面，投入大量精力。这些流程有时能消除冲突的根源。但当冲突真的出现时，可能需要很长时间才能解决，因为绿色寻求群体和谐与全员一致通过的解决方案。不过，硬性冲突通常最后还是由老板来解决。


  #### **Teal organizations**


  在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/), 冲突被看作人性互动中的一个自然组件，如果能得到有心里安全的支持，一般会被看作是个健康而富有创造力的元素。被优雅而温和处理过的冲突，会为所有相关成员创造出新的可能性和学习收获（智慧）。在蔚蓝组织内，会定期投入时间去有意呈现和识别个人和小组环境内的冲突。一般运用复数步骤的冲突解决方法，每个人都接受冲突管理培训。冲突一般被局限在各个关联方、中介人、或某个被邀请做调节员的同事。这类调解员一般不负责强加某个解决方案。调节的焦点是帮助相关各方自觉找到解决方案。

  **靠组织文化支撑高效的冲突解决方法** 


  冲突解决机制的建立和维持非常困难。这个流程有效运作的前提，是存在一种让成员感觉安全安心，并鼓励成员即使在情感上感觉到不舒服的情况下，还能理智的信赖依靠彼此的职场文化。


  下面是很多蔚蓝组织都潜在运用着的，支撑冲突解决流程的职场文化中的几个基本原则：


  * 不可能改变他人。只能改变自己。

  * 我们对自己的想法、信念、语言和行为负责。

  * 我们不传谣。

  * 我们不在背后议论他人。

  * 我们一对一地解决分歧，不会把其他人拖入问题。

  * 我们在出问题时不推卸责任，埋怨他人。如果感觉到被指责，我们将其看作一种反思的邀请，沉思自己可能对该问题（或其解决方案）负有一定责任。

  * 我们聚焦于强项而不是弱项，聚焦于机遇而不是问题（正向思维）。


  所以，除了准备一些冲突解决流程，还需要建立并维持其他一些构架来支撑这种根基文化。比如，很多组织都发现，建立一套共识的价值观，并将其翻译成具体行为，用于在同事社区中定义需要鼓励的行为，或明确不可接纳的行为，对文化维持很有帮助。很多蔚蓝组织还设置特别的会议，帮助与会者能站在完整人性空间（自我完整与集体完整）与对方互动，致力于觉察并安抚自大人格，保证所有人的声音都被聆听。比如，这可以通过用一分钟冥想启动会议，用轮流感谢言辞结束会议等来实现，也可以定义一个构造化决策流程。另外一个促进支撑文化的关键要素就是办公空间，一个让人感觉到安心的空间，有助于静寂反思，能滋养个体和集体完整性的空间。


  #### **How conflicts are addressed**


  In a conventional workplace, people often raise a dispute with a boss to settle the matter. In self-managing organizations, disagreements are resolved among peers, often using a conflict resolution process. Peers hold each other to account for their mutual commitments and responsibilities. Holding colleagues accountable in this way can feel uncomfortable and Teal organisations sometimes offer support and practices that encourage openness and emotional intelligence to emerge. Broadly there are three types of practices that Teal organizations put in place to help deal with conflicts.


  * First, methods are developed to help people bring tensions to the surface. 

  * Second, clearly defined conflict resolution processes are available to help people safely confront each other when needed. 

  * Third, most self-managing organizations train every new recruit in conflict resolution and interpersonal skills. 


  ##### ***Bringing tensions to the surface***


  It can be hard for someone to stand up to a colleague and say, “We need to talk.”. Processes used by some organizations include regularly scheduled group meetings, company retreats, purpose circles and values days. Surfacing becomes a way of helping others to view conflict as normal, creative and a way of learning about diversity and difference. These practices enable others to share their vulnerabilities, see [creating safe spaces](../safe-space/).


  Here are some examples:


  * At ESBZ, a school in Berlin, every class gets together at a fixed time each week to discuss and deal with tensions in the group. The meeting is facilitated by a student, who supports a number of ground rules that keep the discussion safe. 

  * At Heiligenfeld, once a year, colleagues in every team rate the quality of their interaction with other teams. The result is a company-wide “heat map” that reveals which teams should have a conversation to improve their collaboration. 

  * RHD holds a bi-monthly “-isms in the workplace" meeting. Anyone feeling that the organization should pay attention to a specific form or occurrence of racism, sexism, or any other “-ism” can join the meeting. 


  ##### ***Conflict resolution processes***


  In self-managing organisations, having a clear and well understood conflict resolution process helps people raise issues. Typical conflict resolution mechanisms include: one-on-one discussion, mediation by a peer and mediation by a panel. Some organizations also use team or individual coaching to work through an upset.


  For example, :


  * In the first phase, the two people sit together and try to sort it out privately. 

  * If they can’t find a solution agreeable to both, they nominate a colleague they both trust to act as a mediator. The mediator doesn’t impose a decision. Rather he or she supports the participants in coming to their own solution. 

  * If mediation fails, a panel of topic-relevant colleagues is convened. Again the panel does not impose a solution. 

  * If resolution is not found, the founder or president might be called into the panel to add to the panel’s moral weight (but again, not to impose a solution). 


  ##### ***Training in Interpersonal skills***


  Because effective conflict resolution skills are so central in self-managing organizations, many organizations train all their colleagues in interpersonal skills to enable them to deal gracefully with conflict. Generally in their first weeks at work, new hires are given foundational training including: self-management, deep listening, dealing constructively with conflict and creating a safe environment. For instance, companies like ESBZ and Buurtzorg train colleagues in [Nonviolent Communication ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication)developed by Marshal Rosenberg.
faq:
  - question: If so much time is spent talking through every conflict, when does the
      work get done?
    answer: Working through conflict in a collaborative way without a solution
      imposed by a boss can take time. However, the structure of Teal
      organizations within which employees are trusted to make decisions
      collaboratively from a place of wholeness and care for others, prevents
      many conflicts from happening in the first place. Also, many Teal
      organizations extensively train their employees in effective communication
      and similar skills that make talking through conflict an easier and faster
      process. Even if resolving conflict does take some extra time, there are
      many benefits, such as increased productivity from happier and more
      empowered workers.
  - question: Doesn’t it usually end up with a few team members doing most of work
      because there is no boss to oversee the situation when someone slacks off?
    answer: In traditional companies, when one person doesn’t deliver, colleagues
      grumble and complain but leave it to the person’s boss to do something
      about it. In self-managing organizations, people have to step up and
      confront colleagues who fail to uphold their commitments. This can
      sometimes be difficult or uncomfortable. Teal organizations invest a lot
      of time and effort in giving people the skills and resources they need to
      do this effectively.
  - question: Are peers really fully trusted to resolve conflicts? In Teal
      organizations there is still a founder or CEO. Doesn’t this person have
      the final say?
    answer: When there is disagreement between two colleagues, they may try to send
      it up to the founder or CEO or other person deemed to have more authority.
      The temptation to settle the matters in this way is resisted. Instead, the
      conflict resolution mechanism helps colleagues work through the conflict
      together. In this way, they learn that their voice is valued and they do
      have the power to hold peers to their commitments, without the
      intervention of a boss, even if it can be uncomfortable at times. A CEO or
      founder might be involved later on if the original colleagues can’t sort
      the issue out one-on-one and if they choose this person as a mediator or
      panel member. But neither a mediator nor a panel can impose a solution.
      Other support may also be requested when teams run into trouble, but
      ultimately the participants must find their own solution.
