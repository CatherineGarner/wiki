  冲突解决是蔚蓝组织体系内的一个至关重要的板块。如果没有上司充当解决纠纷的中介，就需要开发一种新流程来处理冲突。在蔚蓝组织内，冲突解决基于同事连带感的人际关系。如果不努力打造良好的人际关系，就会发现这个流程很难奏效，或根本无效。


  多数蔚蓝组织都以人性的某些基本假设为运作依据：员工都是很有思想，值得信赖的成熟人格，有能力并可靠，能对自己的决策和行为负责。在一个以这些蔚蓝假设为依据的职场内，清晰定义好的冲突解决流程，配合良好的实施培训，能给成员提供一套途径和技巧，用于淡定而优雅的处理不一致见解。


  不同的组织历程阶段，产生了对冲突的不同见解和解决方案，以及实践方式：


  #### **红色组织**


  在[红色模式](../red-organizations/)中，老板或领导者主要是通过行使权力来迫使他人保持一致性。恐惧是组织的粘合剂。一般来说，冲突是通过镇压、权力或统治来处理的，通过制定严格的规则以及惩罚的恐惧来强化权力。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  [琥珀模式](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)在一个层级金字塔结构和自上而下的命令和控制（什么和如何）体系中，对角色进行正规定义。首先重视稳定性，并致力于通过明确定义的角色和流程来维持稳定。



  管理冲突的方法是回避或抑制。掌权者独裁的制定规则，并通常通过律法性行为保障执行。这个类型的组织通常制定强大的人力资源流程，用来管理成员和雇主之间的冲突和不满。


  #### **橙色组织**


  在[橙色模式](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/), 中，虽依然存在着层级结构，但开始采用面向目标的管理（只定义什么；在如何做角度给部下更多的自由）。在许多橙色组织中，虽然有正式的冲突解决程序，但冲突往往得不到良好解决。虽然经常鼓励成员自己去解决分歧，但事实上冲突往往需要通过第三方的干预来解决。一般通过将问题提交给上司，或遵循人力资源规则和流程来完成。这些解决程序一般能给出一定程度上的、中立于冲突双方的第三方客观见解。


  #### **Green organizations**


  The [Green paradigm ](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)again uses a classical pyramid structure, but with a stronger focus on empowerment. Green organizations have values-based cultures that include principles of integrity, respect, and openness. There is a large investment in fostering collaboration, communication, problem solving and drafting agreements that meet underlying needs. These processes can sometimes remove the source of conflict. When they do arise, conflicts can take a long time to resolve as groups seek to find a harmonious solution. However, the boss is usually the final arbiter in conflict situations.


  #### **Teal organizations**


  In [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/), conflict is seen as a natural part of human interaction and, when safely supported, is often viewed as healthy and creative. Conflict handled with grace and tenderness can create possibility and learning for all involved. In Teal organizations time is regularly devoted to surface and address conflicts in individual and group settings. Often formal, multi-step conflict resolution practices are used and everyone is trained in conflict management. Conflict is restricted to the parties involved, and mediators, or peers who might be asked to serve on a mediating panel. Such a panel rarely has responsibility to impose a solution. The focus is instead on helping the involved parties find a solution.

  **An organizational culture that supports effective conflict resolution** 


  Conflict resolution mechanisms can be difficult to put in place and to maintain. The process is effective to the degree that there is a culture within the workplace where people feel safe and encouraged to hold each other to account, even when that feels uncomfortable.


  Here are some basic principles that underlie many of the Teal organisation's approaches to conflict in a supportive culture:


  * It’s impossible to change other people. We can only change ourselves. 

  * We take ownership for our thoughts, beliefs, words, and actions.

  * We don’t spread rumors.

  * We don’t talk behind someone’s back.

  * We resolve disagreements one-on-one and don’t drag other people into  the problem.

  * We don’t blame problems on others. When we feel like blaming, we take it as an invitation to reflect on how we might be part of the problem (and the solution).

  * We focus on strengths more than weaknesses, on opportunities more than problems. 


  Therefore, in addition to specific conflict resolution processes, other structures are needed to create and maintain this type of supportive culture. For instance, many organizations find it helpful to establish a set of values and translate these values into concrete behaviors that are either encouraged or declared unacceptable in the community of colleagues. Many Teal organizations also institute specific meeting practices to help participants interact with each other from a place of wholeness, to keep their egos in check and to ensure everybody’s voice is heard. This might be done by, for example, starting a meeting with a minute of silence, finishing a meeting with a round of appreciation or a structured decision-making process. Another key contributor to a supportive culture is the office space, which should feel safe, provide place for quiet reflection and encourage individual and collective wholeness.


  #### **How conflicts are addressed**


  In a conventional workplace, people often raise a dispute with a boss to settle the matter. In self-managing organizations, disagreements are resolved among peers, often using a conflict resolution process. Peers hold each other to account for their mutual commitments and responsibilities. Holding colleagues accountable in this way can feel uncomfortable and Teal organisations sometimes offer support and practices that encourage openness and emotional intelligence to emerge. Broadly there are three types of practices that Teal organizations put in place to help deal with conflicts.


  * First, methods are developed to help people bring tensions to the surface. 

  * Second, clearly defined conflict resolution processes are available to help people safely confront each other when needed. 

  * Third, most self-managing organizations train every new recruit in conflict resolution and interpersonal skills. 


  ##### ***Bringing tensions to the surface***


  It can be hard for someone to stand up to a colleague and say, “We need to talk.”. Processes used by some organizations include regularly scheduled group meetings, company retreats, purpose circles and values days. Surfacing becomes a way of helping others to view conflict as normal, creative and a way of learning about diversity and difference. These practices enable others to share their vulnerabilities, see [creating safe spaces](../safe-space/).


  Here are some examples:


  * At ESBZ, a school in Berlin, every class gets together at a fixed time each week to discuss and deal with tensions in the group. The meeting is facilitated by a student, who supports a number of ground rules that keep the discussion safe. 

  * At Heiligenfeld, once a year, colleagues in every team rate the quality of their interaction with other teams. The result is a company-wide “heat map” that reveals which teams should have a conversation to improve their collaboration. 

  * RHD holds a bi-monthly “-isms in the workplace" meeting. Anyone feeling that the organization should pay attention to a specific form or occurrence of racism, sexism, or any other “-ism” can join the meeting. 


  ##### ***Conflict resolution processes***


  In self-managing organisations, having a clear and well understood conflict resolution process helps people raise issues. Typical conflict resolution mechanisms include: one-on-one discussion, mediation by a peer and mediation by a panel. Some organizations also use team or individual coaching to work through an upset.


  For example, :


  * In the first phase, the two people sit together and try to sort it out privately. 

  * If they can’t find a solution agreeable to both, they nominate a colleague they both trust to act as a mediator. The mediator doesn’t impose a decision. Rather he or she supports the participants in coming to their own solution. 

  * If mediation fails, a panel of topic-relevant colleagues is convened. Again the panel does not impose a solution. 

  * If resolution is not found, the founder or president might be called into the panel to add to the panel’s moral weight (but again, not to impose a solution). 


  ##### ***Training in Interpersonal skills***


  Because effective conflict resolution skills are so central in self-managing organizations, many organizations train all their colleagues in interpersonal skills to enable them to deal gracefully with conflict. Generally in their first weeks at work, new hires are given foundational training including: self-management, deep listening, dealing constructively with conflict and creating a safe environment. For instance, companies like ESBZ and Buurtzorg train colleagues in [Nonviolent Communication ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication)developed by Marshal Rosenberg.
faq:
  - question: If so much time is spent talking through every conflict, when does the
      work get done?
    answer: Working through conflict in a collaborative way without a solution
      imposed by a boss can take time. However, the structure of Teal
      organizations within which employees are trusted to make decisions
      collaboratively from a place of wholeness and care for others, prevents
      many conflicts from happening in the first place. Also, many Teal
      organizations extensively train their employees in effective communication
      and similar skills that make talking through conflict an easier and faster
      process. Even if resolving conflict does take some extra time, there are
      many benefits, such as increased productivity from happier and more
      empowered workers.
  - question: Doesn’t it usually end up with a few team members doing most of work
      because there is no boss to oversee the situation when someone slacks off?
    answer: In traditional companies, when one person doesn’t deliver, colleagues
      grumble and complain but leave it to the person’s boss to do something
      about it. In self-managing organizations, people have to step up and
      confront colleagues who fail to uphold their commitments. This can
      sometimes be difficult or uncomfortable. Teal organizations invest a lot
      of time and effort in giving people the skills and resources they need to
      do this effectively.
  - question: Are peers really fully trusted to resolve conflicts? In Teal
      organizations there is still a founder or CEO. Doesn’t this person have
      the final say?
    answer: When there is disagreement between two colleagues, they may try to send
      it up to the founder or CEO or other person deemed to have more authority.
      The temptation to settle the matters in this way is resisted. Instead, the
      conflict resolution mechanism helps colleagues work through the conflict
      together. In this way, they learn that their voice is valued and they do
      have the power to hold peers to their commitments, without the
      intervention of a boss, even if it can be uncomfortable at times. A CEO or
      founder might be involved later on if the original colleagues can’t sort
      the issue out one-on-one and if they choose this person as a mediator or
      panel member. But neither a mediator nor a panel can impose a solution.
      Other support may also be requested when teams run into trouble, but
      ultimately the participants must find their own solution.
