  唯一恒在的是变化。 —赫拉克利特^\[Heraclitus, quoted by Diogenes Laërtius in Lives and
  Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]


  大自然、人类、关系：所有一切都在进化，都在生命力的驱动下，不断适应、转型和成长。从蔚蓝组织角度来看，组织被看作一种携带目标的独立能量场，能穿透所有的参与者。在这个模式中，我们并不拥有或能运营某个组织，我们只是组织的仆人，聆听组织想去哪里，然后帮助组织在这个世界里完成其任务...

  “跟其他所有生命系统一样，每个组织都处在相关进化中。组织的各种性格和能力，会在与可能性的游戏中不断浮现出来。组织会与其他生命单元之间进行大量的无章法混沌互动，然后逐步诞生一个可行性体系而开始有序成长。这个系统会开发出一些未曾规划的能力和信念。自行完成无人设计的各种工作。演化出无需管理的（人际）关系。如果我们焦灼的考量一些设计和结构，强扭的流程和规则，执着的进行统治和控制，就永不会成功的创造出一个蔚蓝组织。组织作为生命体，渴望着自行发生。人类组织会自行诞生于一些可以去理解但绝不要用来控制的流程。”

  一个组织的目的是什么？虽然很多现代组织有个“使命标语”，但通常都是个空洞的口号，不能真正的指导决策机制，因而事实上决策参与者完全不知道这个标语的存在。于是多数传统组织不是被集体的目标驱动着，而是被某种自我求生欲望支撑着。意识1.0之红色，琥珀，橙色模式中那种基于恐惧的特性，在领导和成员中根植了一种恐惧天性，将世界看作一个危险的空间，充满欲抢自己饭碗的竞争对手。唯一的求生途径就是不择手段谋取利益，在损人（竞争对手）利己的原则下获得市场份额。在这场红海战役中，谁还有余暇考虑目标话题？不幸的是，基于恐惧的竞争优先思维，即使在组织生存不成问题的阶段，也占资源投入的最优势。在一些被保护在竞争环境之外的组织内（比如军队，公立学校，政府部门），基于恐惧的人格还是会将能量优先投入到对安全的追求，此时竞争会发生在组织内部。经理们卷入与其他部门的战争，为自己部门的存活而战，攫取更多资金、人才、或荣誉。朝向进化性的蔚蓝组织转型后，人们能逐渐学会驯服自己自大人格中的各种恐惧。这个过程能节省能量，用于探索开发关于个人和集体之生命意义和目标的更深层主题：我的使命是什么？真正值得达成的是什么？求生不再是蔚蓝组织的聚焦之处。基础目标终于得到重视。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  在蔚蓝组织内，自大人格驱动的求生欲望，已经被一种强有力的，希望为实现带有深远意义目标而工作（使命）的渴望所替代。如果组织不能做出一些值得成员付出能量、才能和创造力的产出，那个“做最好员工”的概念就只是个空洞的目的。蔚蓝模式认为，每个组织都有自己的身份、生命力量和使命。波瑞安罗伯森作为蔚蓝组织霍尔公司的创始人，用进化目标来描述这个现象。认为组织跟个人同样，都天然具备一个使命和用于推向该目标的进化性能量：在蔚蓝组织内，自大人格驱动的求生欲望，已经被一种强有力的，希望为实现带有深远意义目标而工作（使命）的渴望所替代。如果组织不能做出一些值得成员付出能量、才能和创造力的产出，那个“做最好员工”的概念就只是个空洞的目的。蔚蓝模式认为，每个组织都有自己的身份、生命力量和使命。波瑞安罗伯森作为蔚蓝组织霍尔公司的创始人，用进化目标来描述这个现象。认为组织跟个人同样，都天然具备一个使命和用于推向该目标的进化性能量：

  组织的身份是什么？组织到底想要什么？这个比喻很类似母子旅程：...我们承认自己的孩子有其独自的身份及其独立的人生道路与目标。不能只因为我可能很希望孩子当个医生，就可以将自己的需求投射在孩子身上。如果我强制投射，就会发生一种有害的纠缠依赖关系。我们作为成熟的父母已经知道，健康的为亲之道就是努力去催化这个亲子各不相同的旅程。而正是这种亲子差异，允许双方获得各自特有的更完整的主权和身份，这些素质进而能促进个体开发出一种在人际关系和互联互动中更有意识的融合能力，这是一种同行者的关系，是平等的。...正确的定位是，成员要跟组织的目标共鸣，设法区分个体与组织的身份并揣摩出“该组织的使命是什么？”。不是“我们想利用这个组织作为私有财产，来达成什么目的？”而是“这个组织作为生命体，作为有机系统，具有何种潜力？” 进化目标的含义：一种最深次元的创造性潜力，能为某些新事物赋予生命，能对对这个世界做出某些价值和能量贡献。...我们要聆听并让组织生命体的这种创造性脉冲或潜力驱动自己的行为，而不是用个人的欲望影响组织行为。^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09) Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 4322).

  The evolutionary purpose is not the same as a vision statement. A vision statement usually reflects the ego-driven state of consciousness of the management team, who decide what they want the organization to be.


  The evolutionary purpose of a Teal organization reflects the deeper reason the organization exists. It relates to the difference it wants to make in the community it operates in, as well as in the marketplace it serves. It is not concerned with competition or outperforming others; it is serving the ‘greater good’ that matters. Some examples are:


  * "Helping home-based patients become healthy and autonomous" - Buurtzorg, healthcare organization^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 4239-4240). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition]

  * "Use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis” - Patagonia, outdoor clothing retailer^\[http://www.patagoniaworks.com/#index, accessed 2015/06/13] 

  * "Two fundamental purposes: the first is to provide meaningful work in the area of Hallencourt, a rural area in northern France where good work is rare; the second is to give and receive love from clients" - FAVI, foundry and engineering firm.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 4371-4372). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.] 


  For Teal organizations, this transition to evolutionary purpose has profound implications for how they view such fundamental concepts as competition, growth and profit. While Orange organizations seem to be obsessed with beating the competition (as exemplified by the title of the ex-CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch’s. book, Winning), Teal organizations seem to lose the very notion of competition. Since the Teal organization truly lives for its purpose, anyone that can help to achieve that purpose is viewed as an ally, not a competitor. For an example of this in practice, see “Concrete Examples for Inspiration - Buurtzorg” below.


  Growth, in the same vein, is only an objective insofar as the purpose can be manifested on a larger scale, but never an objective in itself. Buurtzorg, for example, actively helps patients build a network of support with their families, friends, and neighbors. It basically tries to make itself irrelevant in patients’ lives as quickly as possible, which it does very successfully: a 2009 study showed that Buurtzorg’s patients get released from care twice as fast as competitors’ clients, and they end up claiming only 50 percent of the prescribed hours of care. Buurtzorg’s core strategy— helping patients become healthy and autonomous— in fact comes down to pursuing less growth, not more. Similarly, Patagonia is famous for having run full-page ads reading, “Don’t buy this jacket.” The ads were part of its “Common Threads Partnership.” Patagonia reckons that many of us in the developed world have enough clothes in our closets to keep us warm for a lifetime. And yet we keep buying new clothes, which are environmentally harmful to produce and will end up in a landfill. The Common Threads Partnership takes a serious stab at reducing (making clothes that last longer), repairing (Patagonia repairs clothes for its customers), reusing (the company resells your used clothes on eBay or in their stores’ Worn Wear section), and recycling (you can return your old clothes to Patagonia and they recycle them). Will this initiative harm Patagonia’s growth in the short term? Yes. Every repaired and every reused jacket is one less jacket bought. Will it increase its growth in the long term, through higher customer loyalty? Perhaps. But Patagonia’s decision wasn’t driven by forecasts and financials. The company chose the path its purpose called for.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  The notion of profit changes fundamentally in Teal as well. Increasing shareholder value has become the dominant perspective of Orange Organizations. It states that corporations have one overriding duty: to maximize profits. In many countries, this perspective is legally binding; management can be sued for decisions that jeopardize profitability. Under the spell of shareholder value, public companies focus relentlessly on the bottom line. Teal for-profit organizations have a different perspective on profit. Profit is necessary and investors deserve a fair return, but the objective is purpose, not profit. Teal founders often use the same metaphor: profit is like the air we breathe. We need air to live, but we don’t live to breathe. Tami Simon, the CEO of Sounds True, gives the definition of a business’s purpose: “We have this idea about business— everything we do has to help us make more money, be more productive or whatever. But that’s not my view of business. My view of business is that we are coming together as a community to fill a human need and actualize our lives”.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 4253-4264). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  In Teal Organizations, profits are a byproduct of a job well done. Philosopher Viktor Frankl captures this well: “Success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side -effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself.”^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 4264-4266). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


  The purpose of a Teal organization is rarely static – thus the term “Evolutionary Purpose”. It will evolve over time, as the organization itself grows and adapts. For example, Buurtzorg, the Dutch homecare organization, was set up to "help sick and elderly patients live a more autonomous and meaningful life."^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 4215-4216). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.] Its activities have grown beyond looking after the elderly, and it now focuses on helping "patients become healthy and autonomous".
faq:
  - question: Can there be a conflict between individual and organizational purpose?
    answer: Individual and organizational purpose go hand in hand. One needs the
      other to flourish. When the individual and organizational purpose enter
      into resonance and reinforce each other, extraordinary things can happen.
      When work meets vocation — an encounter that theologian Frederick Buechner
      described as “the place where your deep gladness meets the world’s deep
      hunger”— then members of an organization can pour their heart and soul
      into their work. They are fulfilled as human beings, not as productive
      units. At the same time, the organization's evolutionary purpose is
      furthered and allowed to grow.
